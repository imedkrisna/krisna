 My name is Krisna, some calls me Imed. I am a lecturer at Politeknik APP Jakarta, a vocational school under Ministry of Industry. My research is about trade and investment policy and how it affects Indonesian firms. I use some structured equation such as GTAP model, but also do some empirics like gravity models.

 I am a lecturer at Politeknik APP Jakarta (full-time) and Universitas Indonesia. Additionally, I assume a senior fellow position at Center for Indonesian Policy Studies.
