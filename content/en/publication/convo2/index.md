In this article, me and my colleague Wishnu Mahraddika write about the recent development of Indonesia's new MoU with South Korean cell battery producer, LG Energy Solution.

More needs to be done, however, to ensure that the flow of goods remain strong so it can explore global export market as well as input market.
