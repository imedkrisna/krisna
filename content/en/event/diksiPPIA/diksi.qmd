### Today

- Does ASEAN Matter?

- RCEP

- EV

- Food security

:::
::::

## The ASEAN Summit

- The ASEAN 42nd Summit produces [several declarations](https://asean.org/42nd-asean-summit/) like the AEC post-2025, regional development of electric vehicle (EV) ecosystem, and regional payment connectivity.

- The theme is "ASEAN Matters: Epicentrum of Growth"

    - ASEAN is aspired to be a stable region in the midst of global uncertainty
    
    - Remains committed to regionalism & multilateralism
    
    - but does ASEAN really matter?

- China still dominates trade, while USA in FDI inflow.

## ASEAN matters?

- Challenges going forward remains: 

    - a weaker global growth, with growth estimated to be [just 2.3% in 2023](https://asean2023.id/en/page/asean-2023/epicentrum-of-growth)
    
    - inward-lookingness & geopolitical rivalry, with EU, China, and the US are trying to reduce their interdependence.
    
    - Climate change devastate food security & requires resources to tackle

- Opportunities are there: RCEP & the region's commitment to multilateralism.

## RCEP

:::: columns
::: {.column width="47%"}

- ASEAN+5 FTA (sort of)

- Enacted in 2020. [The Philippines ratified RCEP](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/06/15/america-is-losing-ground-in-asian-trade) in June 2$^{nd}$ 2023.

- Covers trade in goods, services, investment and movement of natural persons.

- Also covers development cooperation.

## About RCEP

- The impact from tariff is negligible: about [0.07% higher real income](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/06/15/america-is-losing-ground-in-asian-trade) from World Bank's estimate.

- Outside tariff, the agreement seems watered down:

    - not enough immediate commitment in the agreement on issues such as non-tariff measures, investment, government procurement, and competition.
    
    - many of the issues will be depending on the future RCEP secretariat & each countries' commitment.
    
## Rules of Origin

- The gain will come from the new Rules of Origin (RoO): The one region RoO rules.

- Single region RoO means a good that uses components from various RCEP countries will be counted as originated from RCEP.

- This rules streamlined previous "spaghetti bowl" created by ASEAN+1 FTAs.

- This is a perfect environment for Regional Value Chain (RVC) industries.

## Can RCEP works?

- The RoO can only be utilised by also [streamlining](https://www.eastasiaforum.org/2022/06/08/can-rcep-overcome-obstacles-to-trade-reform/) various non-tariff measures (NTMs) like standards & import/export control.

- However, the region is increasingly more protective:

    - in ASEAN, [NTMs has risen](https://www.eastasiaforum.org/2022/06/08/can-rcep-overcome-obstacles-to-trade-reform/) from 1,634 to 5,975 between 2000 to 2015.
    
    - domestic policies
    
- Geopolitically, RCEP may push ASEAN [more towards China](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/06/15/america-is-losing-ground-in-asian-trade). Can the region still be independent?

    - We'll see how IPEF change the equation.

## Climate change

- Climate change is real, and EV adoption has been dubbed as one of the most efficient way to deal with it.

- The region hops the EV train: [ASEAN Leader's Declaration on Developing Regional Electric Vehicle Ecosystem.](https://asean.org/asean-leaders-declaration-on-developing-regional-electric-vehicle-ecosystem/).

- Not only good for the climate, EV is so different compared to conventional car, the advantage of the incumbent matter less.

## Vehicle trade

:::: columns
::: {.column width="47%"}

- ASEAN's vehicles are quite competitive ([7th largest](https://www.iseas.edu.sg/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/ISEAS_Perspective_2022_112.pdf)).

- BYD, Wuling, Hyundai already has presence, VinFast is promising.

- Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand's incentives rolled in: USD 465, 560, 2032 per vehicle respectively.

## Challenges

- EV, despite subsidies, are still [relatively expensive](https://www.iseas.edu.sg/articles-commentaries/iseas-perspective/2022-112-mapping-the-surge-in-ev-production-in-southeast-asia-by-tham-siew-yean/) in the region.

- production may require the global market to benefit from economies of scale

    - turning inward & global rivalry, again.
    
    - regional rivalry vs multilateralism. Case in point: Latin America in the 80s.
    
- Don't forget about infrastructure!

## Food Security {.m}

- Climate change reduces the productivity of the agriculture sector, while Russia's aggresion leads to a wheat and fertilizer crisis.

- The region remains relatively in the [middle](https://asean2023.id/en/news/food-security-an-aseans-priority) according to The Economist's [Global Food Security Index (GFSI)](https://impact.economist.com/sustainability/project/food-security-index/):

| Country | SGP | MYS | VNM | IDN | THA | PHL | MMR | KHM | LAO |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Rank | 28 | 41 | 46 | 63 | 64 | 67 | 72 | 78 | 81 |
| Score | 73.1 | 69.1 | 67.9 | 60.2 | 60.1 | 59.3 | 57.6 | 55.7 | 53.1 |
    
## Food security

- The ASEAN Integrated Food Security ([AIFS](https://asean.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/42-AIFS-Framework-SPAFS-Final-13-July-2020.pdf)) Framework was crucial in helping to solve food crisis during the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and COVID Crisis.

- The framework helps with monitoring, reacting to crisis, and keeping trade open.

- There is no way around increasing productivity: rice & palm oil yield are reducing amid climate change and limited land.

- Thankfully, commitment in food security is strong.

## Closing

- Economy-wise, ASEAN remains relatively small, but an important region nonetheless in the midst of global rivalry.

- The summit remains committed to multilateralism, seems like.

- RCEP, commitment to regional EV development and food security will determine whether ASEAN really does matter: to become the epicentrum of growth!
