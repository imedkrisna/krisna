## Basic assumption

- No economics and/or mathematics background.

- Some experience in CIPS' work.

- chance is, I can learn from you. So please don't be shy.

## Why Economics

- Economics is NOT about (just) money!

- Economics is a study of optimization: how to get the best under constraints.

    - The same with engineers!
    
    - We use very similar tools!
    
- Economists are just a bunch of people who use thermodynamics to explain your daily problems!
    
- Increasingly, economics also do empirics!

## Theory vs Empirics

- Theory: If X leads to Y while Z does not lead to Y, then lets do X.

- Does X really lead to Y while Z does not?

- The first is the optimization part, the second is the empirical part.

- But stil, relationship between Xs & Ys is what interests all economists.

## Some questions

- How to best tackle climate change?

- Is minimum wage good?

- Should we ban trade to industrialize?

- How to best feed our people?

- Should we invest in school or road?

## About economics

- Some of my blogpost to get a glympse of what economists do:

    - [Consumption-saving decision](https://www.krisna.or.id/post/surga/)
    
    - [how to set the price on toll road](https://www.krisna.or.id/post/jorr/)
    
    - [FDI, trade and industry policy](https://www.krisna.or.id/post/hitektrade/)


- Naturally, economists often specialize more on issues.

    - I'm more on trade, industry, investment. Knows next to nothing about education & welfare program issues.
    
## Why people make choices

- The main reason is resources' scarcity.

- resource = anything you use to get what you want.

- mainstream resources are money; Given 4k trilyun APBN, what program should we finance?

- But other resources are important too: time, people/institutions, inflation.

## Opportunity cost

- The true cost of something is its possible other uses. Money is the least of our concern.

- The cost of having holiday, for example, is the money & time you could otherwise use to join a short course.

- The cost of doing an S1:
    
    - Go straight to work, get experiences & money
    
    - Do other degree
    
    - enjoy life
    
- I daresay opportunity cost is the core concept of economics!

## Thinking at the margin

- The principle of opportunity cost leads to a marginal thinking

- understand the status quo, then think if it can be (marginally) improved.

- e.g., say you have 2 hours to spent on work or play. how to divide?

    - depends: when's the work deadline?
    
    - if you work for another 30 minutes, would that help with work?
    
## Specialization & trade

- During your daily time, you make decisions on allocating how much time to study and to cook, among other things.

- Since you will die if you don’t eat, you can’t allocate 0 hour to cook.

- On the other hand, there are those who are very good cook and will cook for you for a little money.

- In this case, it may be better if you spend 0 hour to cook, and order food from these chefs.
  
- Trade is the reason why I can study economics: I don’t have to study how to be a doctor. I will just go to the hospital if I need a medical service.

## One family economy

- Picture this: your household decided to be independent[^1], and you print your own currency.

- To fulfill your "country" needs, you need to choose: swasembada or trade.

- Swasembada: you make everything yourselves with everything you have: food, education, healthcare (internet is counted as import!)

- Trade: things you normally do right now: you focus on your trade, "sell" them outside, and "import" the rest!

[^1]: this is not an advice. Please don't try this at home

## SPecialization & trade

- Extending to firm level:

    - Why build our own office suit if we can buy microsoft office?
    
    - Why build our own server if there's AWS, Biznet, others?
    
- Easily extending this to country level:

    - Japan's capital & labor are mobilized to make cars cuz they get less if they plant palm oil.

- Remember: export is beneficial because we can import from the revenue!
    
## Typical problem

- Most policy makers & policy analysts are stumble in the trade argument because they often forgot about **resource constraints** and **opportunity cost**.

    - leads to a macro-policy which aims at increasing **everything**.
    
- our land, workforce, APBN, etc are limited.

- Even if you have a lot of resources, for example, the extra money could be better spent to grow one thing.

## Political context

- There is almost no policy that's not biased: benefits some sub-population while hurts others.

    - Agriculture Imports hurts farmers while helps consumers and industrialists.
    
    - Scholarships benefit smart individuals & high-skilled industries.
    
    - All subsidies benefit targeted groups at the expense of taxpayers.
    
- Economists often focuses on generalization and leaning toward policies that improves **aggregate welfare**

## Equilibrium

- When there is an incentive to do something, there will be more and more people exploit it.

- As more people do it, the incentive decreases to a point where it is not worth it anymore.

- examples:
  
    - City becomes more crowded (and costly to live in).
  
    - Countries' economic growth reduced after they get rich.

- Movement towards equilibrium, however, varies.

    - short run vs long run,individual vs aggregate.

## Conclusion

- Main principles: scarcity, opportunity cost, marginal thinking, & equilibrium.

- Economics gets much more complicated that this.

- The principle, however, remains the same (more or less)

## Discussion

Consider a country called Kuvukiland which has 2 industries: wheat and bread, and 3 classes of people: consumers, farmers who work in the wheat industry, and bakers who work in the bread industry. Consumers eat only bread & all wheat goes to bakers. Technology is simple: 1 bushel of wheat -> 1 loaf of bread. Price bread = price wheat.

With no trade, farmers produce 8 ton wheat at P=7000. With trade, Kuvukiland can import with international prices at P=6000, demand rises to 10 ton, but at that price, farmers only produce 6 ton. 4 ton are imported.

Discuss: is trade better? Who benefits? If there's a ballot, who will vote for free trade?

## Writing a policy paper

- This is not a writing drill. Everybody has their own style.

- However, there are some things that you may want to have in your writing.

- Don't forget to keep the principle in our previous learning in your mind while doing this.

## Public Policy Principle

- We often write something theoretical [(like this for example)](https://www.cips-indonesia.org/publications/the-advent-of-a-new-trade-governance-after-the-omnibus-law%3A-neraca-komoditas) but also something more empirics [(like this for example)](https://www.cips-indonesia.org/publications/technology-and-knowledge-transfers-to-dairy-farms%3A-private-sector-contribution-to-improve-milk-production)

- Well, in reality, it is not so useful differentiating the two. We often just mix them.

- However, you can see the pattern of these works are somewhat similar:

    - Does policy X really leads to outcome Y?
    
    - Is there a better way to get Y? Maybe policy Z is actually better than X?

## What to look for?

When we write about policy, aim for these things:

1. Problem definition

1. Policy targets

1. Policy assessments

1. Assess alternative options

## Problem definition

- Why the regulation is needed? The reason often boils down to the presence of market failure, inefficient prior regulations, or new targets.

- Find this in a "menimbang" part, sometimes at "pasal 2", but sometimes in the media. 

- Some regulations try to tackle more than one problem, so list them accordingly. 

- Your paper may or may not contain regulation, but the problem definition is a must-have.

- See if these problems can be translated into policy targets.

## Policy targets

- If you write on a particular policy, first you must tell readers what it is and how does it work.

- You must state boldly what it tries to achieve, then you must focus these targets.

- Identify whether you can relatively easily inspect those targets.

- Identify which target the government say it has been achieved, and check whether it's true.

- If you're not studying a particular policy, then state these targets in your policy recommendations.

## Policy target

![contoh di Perpres 32/2022 tentang Neraca Komoditas](goal.png)

## Policy assessment {.m}

- The assessment part usually straightforward. See if you can argue or find data on it.

    - make sure you understand the mechanism from the policy to the result.
    
    - e.g. how CPO exports (the policy) leads to lower domestic prices?
    
- If you know the mechanism, it is easier to find the gap:

    - CPO exports failed amid wrong assumption: $P\downarrow \Rightarrow Q\downarrow$
    
- Assess qualitatively if finding hard data is not easy.

    - find evidence like recordings/article of government agents' speech/inverview, news articles, government reports, etc.

- as long as you focus on the policy $\rightarrow$ target mechanism, should be fine.

## Check/offer alternatives

- Try to hypothesize policy alternatives, and see if it would have worked better!

    - Always remember the context around the policy!

    - No policy IS a policy!
    
- You can try to look for papers or studies on similar policy under different context (usually policies in different countries).

- Approach with Cost-Benefit!

    - Think of cost as not just money.opportunity cost guys!
    
    - Benefit also lies beyond money.
    
## Usual problems

- Target is often not realistic / too broad. (e.g., Free Trade Agreement -> higher exports)

- Correlation is not the same as causation:

    - reverse causality (X causes Y or Y causes X).
    
    - spurious correlation (X & Y moves together $\neq$ one cause another).
    
    - no counterfactual (Try to theorize the counterfactual or better yet use causal inference techniques)
    
- Short-termism / overestimation.
    
## Usual problems

- You must also think in a power balance / political context (vested interests):

    - Which class / part of populations gets the benefit? Which one bear the cost?
    
    - Who would help your advocation, who will block it?
    
    - Almost all policy is about "keberpihakan"
    
- "Government" is a really broad term. In truth, they're vastly different between & within Ministries/Agencies: interests, KPI, qualities, party, etc.

    - their cooperation can't be taken for granted.
    
## Usual problems

- The consequence of a target is often unclear for policy makers.

    - Blocking milk imports -> dwarves manufacturing growth (well this is partly vested interests)
    
- The consequence of a target may be worth it

    - Maybe its okay to be poor as long as we can call ourselves agriculture nation?
    
    - A grand mosque maybe more important than good schools?
    
- We assess, but it's political decision in the end.

## Usual problems

- Context matter heavily, especially institutional capacity.

    - In developed countries, subsidies work well because almost everyone has bank accounts.
    
    - Finance is less of a problem in developed countries.
    
    - Corruption. I don't have to say more.
    
    - Governments often didn't know what's a reform mean.
    
- We often needs to be creative because we face different constraints compared to other countries.

    - liberalization dominates policy advice in a country with a bad government.

## Some more tips

- Be aware of your own biases

    - If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.
    
    - Try your best to keep your mind open, listen to as many vantage points as you can.
    
- ["adding things"](https://www.sciencealert.com/here-s-why-our-brains-always-want-to-solve-problems-by-adding-not-taking-away) problem.

    - more budget! More words/pages! More regulations!
    
- Again, always keep power balance & political games in mind.

## Bottom line

- Look for the actual problems & the policy targets

- Assess for alternatives & look for typical cause of why a policy fails (or potentially fails)

- Use hard data if you can, assess qualitatively if you can't.

- Remember to understand the political context behind every policy.

## Exercise

- Can you identify those points in the policy analysis must-haves? Use whatever policy paper/brief you're familiar with or use [this piece](https://c95e5d29-0df6-4d6f-8801-1d6926c32107.usrfiles.com/ugd/c95e5d_7735b11428c94102a3ff186b55058b2a.pdf)
