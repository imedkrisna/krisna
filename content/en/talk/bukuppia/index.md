On Thursday, September 10<sup>th</sup> 2020, I was appointed as a host as well as moderator in a webinar series of our book (in Bahasa Indonesia), "Mewujudkan Indonesia 4.0: Kumpulan pemikiran pelajar Indonesia di Australia." This event is a joint effort of Indonesian Studentsâ€™ Association of Australia (PPI Australia) and Sobat Cyber Indonesia.

This event is a part of a series of launching our book. The Grand launching was conducted with a collaboration with Indonesian embassy in Canberra a week before, September 3<sup>rd</sup> 2020 to be exact. We then follow it up with webinars for each of a section after that. The detailed webinar series is available at PPI Australia's instagram account, [@ppiaustralia](https://www.instagram.com/ppiaustralia/?hl=en)

In this event focused on economics, the speakers are:

- Professor doctor Suharnomo, Dekan FEB Universitas Diponegoro, also the head of Indonesian association of economic and business faculty (AFEBI). 
- Aditia Prasta, ST., MM, head of Indonesia Investment Promotion Center (IIPC) London. 
- Monasisca Noviani, a master student from Monash University, Melbourne and also one of the author of a chapter in the book

The keynote speaker of this event was Indonesian Ministry of Industry, Dr. Agus Gumiwang Kartasasmita, M.Si. The Minister share a little bit about Indonesian economy and manufacturing in Indonesia, and how it was impacted by the COVID-19. Making Indonesia 4.0 is also experiencing some revisions amid the pandemic.
