# Introduction

.pull-left[
- Indonesia relies in manufacturing sector to boost growth  

- Emphasize on tech upgrade

- also on export-led  growth

- This means more openness:

 - financing R&D
 - import $\Rightarrow$ tech-upgrade (Castellani and Fassio 2019)

# Trend is on the opposite

- However, Protectionism is on the rise, including in Indonesia (Patunru 2018)

- Since GFC, While overall tariff went down, Non-Tariff Measures went up

- The role of Ministry of Industry is increasing (e.g., National Standards (SNI) and Local Content Requirement (LCR)) (Munadi 2019)

- Pandemic has accelerated the trend, potentially using tariff as well

- Protectionism policies may lead to more policies:
 - US trade war Case: iron $\Rightarrow$ appliances
 - Indonesian Case: corn & soybean $\Rightarrow$ chicken, mobile phone

# Introduction

- The straightforward question:

> To what extent tariff and NTMs affect firm's productivity?

- Further investigation is conducted:

 - does size matter? (core question since Melitz (2003))
 
 - how does protectionism affect employment?
 
 - can NTMs reduces firms' imports in general?
 
- Building from Amiti and Konnings (2007), I estimate TFP and use it as the dependent variable

- Key data sources:
  - Tariff data are scrapped from MoF regulations
  - NTM from TRAINS database
  - Firm's characteristics & trade: Survei Industri and Customs data from BPS from 2008 to 2012

# Brief Literature Review

<br />

# On trade and industry

- On the role of international trade and trade policies to firm's performance, literature is abundant:

  - Help firm **access better inputs** (Amiti and Konings 2007; Bas and Strauss-Kahn 2014; Castellani and Fassio 2019; Ing, Yu and Zhang 2019)
  - Help firms **innovate** and be **more productive** (Bas and Strauss-Kahn 2014, Pierola, Fernandez and Farole 2018; Ing, Yu and Zhang 2019; Pane and Patunru 2019)
  - Help firms from developing countries **access** the more lucrative **foreign markets** (An and Maskus 2009; Cadot et al. 2015; Fugazza, Olarreaga and Ugarte 2017)

- How to measure performance of industries and firms:
  
  - most of the literature **uses export** (value, quantity, price, scope)
  - some criticism includes **endogeneity** and the role of export to more **meaningful metrics** (such as GDP, employment and wage)
  - The alternative is using **TFP** (Amiti and Konings 2007; Pane and Patunru 2019)

<br />

# On Using TFP

- Using TFP is preferable (Indonesian context):
  
  - Trade policy is arguably 'less endogenous' to firm's TFP:
        - Indonesian government often aim for CAD (Patunru 2018), not firms TFP.
        - Manufacturing Firms' influence over tariff is less strong (Amiti and Konings 2007; Mobarak and Purbasari 2005)
  
  - Firm's TFP is a more meaningful metric than export

- TFP estimation:
  - non-linear method (Henningsen and Henningsen 2012) has less restriction, but it is harder to converge and contain less economic intuition.
  - Linear method is preferable but endogeneity needs to be treated:
      - using investment proxy (Olley and Pakes 1998)
      - using intermediate input proxy (Amiti and Konings 2007; Levinsohn and Petrin 2003)

<br />

# On Trade Policies

- The impact of tariff is established, but NTM's impact is mixed (Kee et al. 2009; Cadot et al. 2015)

### On NTMs:

- Price-difference method & Indonesian context (Marks 2018):
  - NTMs correlate with higher domestic price
  - Hard to get consistent data on price
  - possibility that price reflects quality
  
- Most are using categorical variable with AVE-style estimation

- UNCTAD (2017) built an NTM database called TRAINS:
  - Less judgmental (NTM vs NTB)
  - lack depth (Cadot et al. 2015)

<br />

# Firms

- Survei Industri (SI), BPS
  - follows many Indonesian manufacturing since 1970s
  - infos include factor used, foreign ownership, output, fraction of export and import
  - unbalanced, unfortunately
  - Inconsistent fixed asset and energy consumption
  
- Customs data
  - 2008-2012 with firm id to integrate with SI
  - varies with countries and HS-8-digit
  - not exactly match one-on-one with SI
  - can't say for sure if the import is directly used for production

- Not all firms reporting export and import in SI exist in the customs data, and vice-versa
  - may be using third party traders

# TFP estimation

The framework uses two-stage regression:  
first, estimating TFP

$$y_{it}=\beta_0 + \beta_ll_{it}+\beta_kk_{it}+\beta_mm_{it}+\beta_nn_{it}+\epsilon_{it}$$
where:  
$y_{it}$  &nbsp; = log of revenue of firm i at time t  
$l_{it}$  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= log of number of labour  
$k_{it}$ &nbsp; = log of fixed assets  
$m_{it}$ &nbsp;= log of intermediate materials  
$n_{it}$ &nbsp; = log of energy consumption

Use the coefficient to predict TFP:

$$TFP_{it}=y_{it}-\hat{\beta}_{l}l_{it}-\hat{\beta}_kk_{it}-\hat{\beta}_mm_{it}-\hat{\beta}_nn_{it}$$
then estimate the second stage:

$$TFP_{it}=\gamma_0+\gamma_{tariff}tariff_{it}+\gamma_{NTM}NTM_{it}+\eta_{it}$$

---

<br />

# Some problems

let
$$\epsilon_{it}=\omega_{it}+\mu_{it}$$

where $\mu_{it}$ is iid, while $\omega_{it}$ is a productivity shock observed only by managers and may correlate with production decisions.

Olley and Pakes (1996) suggest $\omega_{it}$ follows a first order Markov process and affects a firm's decision on how much to invest (or divest)

$$I_{it}=i(k_{it},\omega_{it})$$
inversed:

$$\omega_{it}=\phi(I_{it},k_{it})$$
Weaknesses of using investment (Levinsohn and Petrin 2003):
- zero investment featured in many datasets (including SI)
- less flexible compared to intermediate input

---

<br />

# Lvinsohn-Petrin Method

Levinsohn and Petrin (2003) suggest using intermediate input

$$\omega_{it}=\phi(m_{it},k_{it})$$
Therefore, the first-stage becomes:

$$y_{it}=\beta_0 + \beta_ll_{it}+\beta_nn_{it}+\phi(m_{it},k_{it})+\mu_{it}$$
Then proceed as follows to estimate TFP.

$$TFP_{it}=y_{it}-\hat{\beta}_{l}l_{it}-\hat{\beta}_kk_{it}-\hat{\beta}_mm_{it}-\hat{\beta}_nn_{it}$$
The command `levpet` in Stata allows for practical use of the LP method (Petrin, Poi and Levinsohn 2005).

<br />

# Trade policy variable

The dataset allows for multiple goods imported for each firm. The most practical way is to use coverage ratios.

$$T_{it}=\frac{\sum tariff_{sc}V_{sc}}{\sum V_{sc}}*100$$
where:
- $T_{it}=$ tariff coverage ratio of firm i at time t,
- $tariff_{sc}=$ tariff imposed on good s from country c at time t
- $V_{sc}=$ value of good s imported from country c by firm i at time t

And for NTMs:

$$C_{\theta it}=\frac{\sum NTM_{\theta sc}V_{sc}}{\sum V_{sc}}*100$$

where $NTM_{\theta sc}$ is the number of NTM $\theta$ imposed on good $s$ from country $c$

background-image: url(normal.PNG)

<br />

# Coverage ratio

- Table 5 shows simple mean (a) and coverage ratios (b)
- As expected, tariffs lie between MFN and FTAs
- Import licenses and quotas are more important than SPS and TBT
- Coverage ratios vs simple mean:
 - no visual difference on tariff
 - firms import more goods with NTMs

- $c_{\theta it} = log(1+C_{\theta it})$
- $FO_{it} =$ foreign ownership of firm i at time t (%)

# Trade policy doesn't seem to matter

.pull-middle[
- Firms in the customs data (possibly) are different
  - they are generally bigger, and bigger firms may have ways to offset trade costs
  
- if size matters, it can be discovered using size interaction.

- $l_{it}=log(Labour_{it})$ is used as a proxy

$$size\_tfp_{it}=tfp_{it}+\gamma_Tt_{it}*l_{it}+\sum_\theta c_{\theta it}*l_{it}$$

# Employment effect

Results from VaL is confusing
- Perhaps employment is more sensitive to change in production cost compared to reported value added?
  
Use change in labour as LHS with the consequence of losing 2008

$$\Delta l_t = log(L_t) - log(L_{t-1})$$
Four regressions are conducted, involving:
- No size interaction (L0) and with size interaction (L1)
- with firm, year, ISIC FE and without FE

# Import value, TFP, and trade policies

- Lastly, I investigate if the main driver of the TFP changes is import.

- I use PPML (Silva and Tenreyro 2008) to regress import value (LHS) against the three different TFPs and trade policies.
  - TFPs are used for interaction as well.

- Gravity variables are sourced from CEPII.

- The regression is conducted in HS-8-digit level.

- Fixed effects (right table) are ISIC, country of origin, and year<sup>1</sup>.

.footnote[
<sup>1</sup> the regression did not converge when the firm fixed effect was used.

# Discussions

##### Trade policies and TFPs
- tariff is negatively affecting TFPs, and the impact is less profound for bigger firms:
  - consistent when fixed effects are used
- Only two NTMs are significant after fixed effects: licensing and competition measures.
- More productive firms import more
- NTM have mixed results: Only TBT and preshipment reduces import

##### Employment
- Tariff also reduces employment, but bigger firms have smaller effect.
- Not all NTMs show a visible significance:
  - SPS, licensing, and export-related measures have the same directional impact as tariff.
  - Pre-shipment inspection have different direction

# Policy recommendation

- More import restriction isn't great:
  - especially if the goal is manufacturing productivity growth.
  - less competitive firms: 
      - less competitive products.
      - less non-commodity exports.
  - may lead to more downstream protection.
  - invites retaliations and decoupling.
  
- Targeting CAD may not be ideal
  - Many countries are fine with long exposure to CAD
  - Intervening with trade is usually inefficient:
      - Halting GVC may lead to even more reliance on commodities to keep CA $>0$
  - the real problem may not actually be trade:
      - discourage import but let SOE issues foreign borrowing?
      - bad debt management $\Rightarrow$ costing manufacturers and consumers

# Caveats

- NTMs have mixed results.
  - Count data isn't ideal
  - May have different impact for different types of NTMs
  - May have different impact on different goods
  - More in-depth studies are needed
  
- The sample is quite restrictive.
  - Importers are different compared to general firms
  - the number of importers is very small
  
- Data isn't perfect.
  - NTM collected in 2015 have slight variation compared to 2018
  - SI have many problems
  - Customs have not go beyond 2012 yet
