# Elasticity and tax
## Week 4
### Krisna Gupta
### 1 March 2021 (updated: 2021-02-28)

---


## Recap on last week

- We use consumer and producer surplus to measure the efficiency of the economy. We want the combination of both to be generally bigger.

- The two face a constant political battle: consumer wants small prices, producers like high prices.

- When market is perfect, intervention often leads to various types of inefficiency

---

## Today

- We will learn about one more intervention: tax.

- before we go there, it is best to understand elasticity first.

---

## What's an elasticity?

- If you are a business owner, understanding elasticity is important aspect to get maximized profit.

- **Price elasticity of demand** of a good is a concept of how much the demand of that good change  its price changes.
  - we usually just say **elasticity** in short.
  
- Maximizing profit requires this knowledge:
  - sometimes it is better to sell cheap to gain huge market share, or sell high if niche.
  
---

## Calculating elasticity

.pull-left[
- Consider the demand curve on the right.

- At `\(P_1=10\)`, the daily traffic is `\(Q_1=140\)`

- When `\(P_2=11\)`, daily traffic drops to `\(Q_2=127.3\)`
]

## Calculating elasticity

.s[
- To calculate elasticity of demand, we first calculate:
  1. percent change in the quantity demanded
  1. percent change in the price

- Formula for no.1:

$$
\tag{1}
\text{% change in }Q^D=\frac{Q_2^D-Q_1^D}{Q_1^D}\times 100
$$


- Formula for no.2:

$$
\tag{2}
\text{% change in P}=\frac{P_2-P1}{P_1}\times 100
$$
]

---

## Calculating elasticity

- for our case, we have:

$$
`\begin{align*}
Q_1^D&amp;=140 &amp; Q_2^D&amp;=127.3 \\ P_1&amp;=10 &amp; P_2&amp;=11
\end{align*}`
$$

- Thus:

$$
`\begin{align}
\text{% change in }Q^D &amp;= \frac{127.3-140}{127.3}\times 100 \\ &amp;=-10 \%
\end{align}`
$$

$$
`\begin{align}
\text{% change in P} &amp;= \frac{11-10}{10}\times 100 \\ &amp;=10\%
\end{align}`
$$

---

## Calculating elasticity

- After we get the numbers from {1} and {2}, we use this formula:

.s[
$$
\tag{3}
\text{Price elasticity of demand}=\frac{\text{% change in }Q^D}{\text{% change in P}}
$$
]

- in our case, we have:
.s[
$$
`\begin{align}
\text{Price elasticity of demand}&amp;=\frac{-10\%}{10\%} \\ &amp;=-1
\end{align}`
$$
]

---

## Calculating elasticity

- Economists are also lazy in writing the minus sign.

- Usually we report demand elasticity in **absolute term**.
  - i.e., we drop the minus sign.
  
- However, since most demand curves are downward sloping, it must be negative
  - hence we automatically knows what it means even when we report in absolute term.

---

## About percent change

Using percent changes is more useful than absolute changes
- Things are usually move on proportion
  - A wealthy person will feel casual getting 1 million IDR because it's probably just a small % of her total wealth.
    
- Quantity and prices have many metrics
  - kgs, litres, units, pairs, units/day, etc
  - IDR, USD, btc, etc.

# Note

In the exam, please use 3 digits decimals.

for example, `\(\pi= 3.14159265359...\)`

please report `\(\pi=3.142\)` on exam.

---

## Interpreting elasticity

- We have seen the elasticity of our toll road case is around 0.16, but what does this mean?

- Note that the elasticity formula has % change in Q at the top, and % change in P at the bottom.

- In a sense, the number shows how much quantity change given the price change.

- that means, the bigger the number of the price elasticity, **the more elastic it is**

## A market is elastic. So what?

Let's have a look at different 'kind' of elasticities and what they mean

We'll begin with two extreme cases of elasticity: zero (0) and infinity ( `\(\infty\)` )

---

## Two extreme cases of elasticity

- Suppose the toll road is the only way to go to work.
  - No matter how high the price, people will still need to use it.
  - Hence, change in the demand of toll road is zero for any change in price.
  
- Suppose shuttlecocks are priced 10.000 IDR
  - If people don't care about the shuttlecocks' color, everyone will buy the pink one if the price drop to 9.900 IDR
  - Everyone won't buy a single one if the price go up only to 10.100 IDR

---

## Types of elasticities

- Most goods are somewhere in between.

- We usually use elasticity=1 as another important division point.

- 1 is a useful barrier because when elasticity=1, that means a change in price by 1 % leads to a change in quantity demanded by 1 %

- elasticity &lt; 1 means the quantity response less than a change in prices, while elasticity &gt; 1 means the quantity is highly responsive, more than the change in price.

]

.pull-right[
![](week4_files/figure-html/grafik5-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;

The flatter the curve, the closer its elasticity to `\(\infty\)`]


---

## Types of demand elasticities

| Elasticity | meaning |
| ---------- | ------- |
| 0 | **perfectly inelastic**. Price doesn't matter |
| &lt; 1 | **inelastic**. Quantity is less responsive to price changes |
| 1 | **unit elastic**. Quantity change exactly the same as the price change in % terms|
| &gt;1 | **elastic**. Quantity response heavily to price changes |
| `\(\infty\)` | **perfectly elastic**. A slight increase of price reduces demand to zero |

---

## Elasticities vary. So what?

- Suppose you wan't to increase the revenue from the toll road operation, what price will you set?

- It is intuitive to think that the higher the price, the better.
  - High price `\(\Rightarrow\)` more revenue

- Is there a problem with this logic?

--

- Remember, demand respond to price. High price `\(\Rightarrow\)` lower demand `\(\Rightarrow\)` less revenue

- The maximum price depends on the demand elasticity

- In a market with high demand elasticity, the quantity effect outweighs the price effect.

- Increasing the price is not so clever if the market's demand is highly elastic.

---

## Last point on demand elasticity

- When elasticity = 1, then `\(A=C\)`
  - hence changing price has no impact on sales revenue.

- Profit oriented in the real life may not very realistic
  - Governments may want to serve as much people as possible
  - In the short run, growth and market cap may be more important than profit.

---

## Last point on demand elasticity

- We usually tied elasticity on a price point.
  - on our toll road case, our price point is 10.000 IDR
  
- Elasticity may differ in different price point.
  - Changing price from 10 to 11 may have different impact compared to changing price from 20 to 21.
      - the first one is an increase of 10%.
      - the second one is an increase of 5%.
      - in absolute term, both are a 1.000 IDR increase.

---

## Last point on demand elasticity

- Estimating elasticity is very hard

- There are many things also at play:
  - different condition in different time
  - different buyer with different characteristics behave differently
  - Income, taste, etc matters (remember what **shifts the demand curve?**)

---

## Factors determine demand elasticity

- A **necessity** good tend to have lower elasticity compared to a **luxury good**.

- The availability of **close substitutes**, like the case with pertamax and shell.

- **Share of income spent** on the good. Rich people may not care with toll road price.

- **Time**. Cigarettes may have low elasticity in the short run because it is so addictive, and adapt later in the long run.

---

## Other types of demand elasticity

- **Cross price elasticity of demand** is how the price of good `\(B\)` affects a demand of good `\(A\)`.

.s[
$$
\tag{4}
\text{Cross-Price elasticity}_{A,B}=\frac{\text{% change in }Q_A}{\text{% change in }P_B}
$$
]

- When good A and good B are subtitutes, then the effect is negative.
  - e.g., Samsung and Xiaomi

- When good A and good B are complements, the effect is positive.
  - e.g., Samsung and Telkomsel

---

## Other types of demand elasticity

- **Income elasticity of demand** is how the chanage on income affects your demand of good `\(A\)`

.s[
$$
\tag{5}
\text{Income elasticity of Demand}_A=\frac{\text{% change in }Q_A}{\text{% change in Income}}
$$
]

- It is usually positive if good `\(A\)` is a **normal good**.

- It is negative if good `\(A\)` is an **inferior good**.
  - you buy less instant noodle when you're richer.
  
---

## Other types of demand elasticity

- **Income elasticity of demand** is how the chanage on income affects your demand of good `\(A\)`

.s[
$$
\tag{5}
\text{Income elasticity of Demand}_A=\frac{\text{% change in }Q_A}{\text{% change in Income}}
$$
]

- A **necessity** good is usually **income inelastic** because you need to buy it no matter what.

- A **luxury** good can be **income elastic**. You only buy it if your main needs are covered so you can wait for a discount.

# Price elasticity of Supply

---

## Price elasticity of Supply

- Supply also have elasticities. As a supplier, you can't afford to sell expensive if there are high competition.

- However, in many cases (such as toll road), entering the market is very hard.

- How easy it is to expand (or for new supplier to enter the market) matters to how responsive can supply react to the change in price.
.s[
$$
\tag{6}
\text{Price elasticity of supply} = \frac{\text{% change in }Q^s}{\text{% change in }P}
$$
]

---

## Two extreme cases of elasticity

.pull-left[
![](week4_files/figure-html/grafik11-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;
.s[an illustration of **perfectly inelastic supply**]
]

.pull-right[
![](week4_files/figure-html/grafik12-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;
.s[an illustration of **perfectly elastic supply**]]

---

## Two extreme cases of elasticity

- In a **perfectly inelastic supply** case, the market can't supply more even if the price increase. Toll road is like this: Building more toll road is expensive and takes time. Most times this is monopolized by the government.

- In a **perfectly elastic supply**, the market supply exactly zero when the price go up just by a little. A highly competitive market where all firms operate at the margin may behave this way.

- Again, most times, the supply curve is somewhere in between.

---

## What changes supply elasticity?

- A market tend to have a highly elastic price elasticity of supply when **inputs are abundant** and can be converted in and out of producion at a very low cost.

- Matters, as price elasticity of supply tend to be higher in the long run. Increasing production capacity may takes time since investing in a new land, building or machine requires **time**.
  - Some goods are even impossible to be increased, hence have zero elasticity. Radio spectrum is one example.

## European farm surplus

European Union **subsidised** their farmers heavily. They probably knew that subsidies create huge **surplus** (remember last week), but they thought the surplus would not be as big since farming land is **limited**.

However, EU farmers were able to expand production using things like fertilizers and pesticides, which are **readily available inputs**.

# The benefits and costs of taxation

---

## Excise Tax (_cukai_)

- The government often tax goods in the form of an excise tax.

- In Indonesia, some goods have an excise to its purchase:
  - Cigarettes &amp; alcohol
  - Luxury goods (PPnBM)

- You can say that a value-added tax is another form of an excise tax.

---

## How tax works

- Tax acts like a price ceiling plus plus floor:
  - The government set a higher price for consumers to pay
  - At the same time, the producers are forced to produced at a lower price.
  
- A reminder: in a **price floor** scenario, surplus from consumer transferred to the producer, while in a **price ceiling**, surplus transferred from producers to consumers.

- in tax case, CS and PS are transferred to the government.

]
.pull-right[.s[
- The market price is `\(P=P_E\)`

- The price paid by consumers is `\(P=P_C\)`

- Producer receive payment at `\(P=P_P\)`

- The tax per purchased good paid to the government is `\(t=P_C-P_P\)`
]]

---

## The impact of taxation

.pull-left[
![](week4_files/figure-html/grafiks7-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;
]

.pull-right[.s[
- Consumer lose `\(A+B\)`

- Producer lose `\(C+D\)`

- The government collects tax revenue `\(TR=T \times Q_T\)`

- This is equals to `\(TR=A+C\)`

- `\(B+D=DWL\)`
]]

---

## The impact of taxation

- As we learn, the tax revenue and the size of DWL depends highly in demand elasticity and supply elasticity of the good.

- The less elastic the demand and supply of a good, the higher revenue gained from taxing the good.
  - i.e., price effect &gt; quantity effect.
  
- DWL also lower when the demand and/or supply of the good is highly inelastic.

## Implication

- If the government wants to collect revenue, its best to impose a tax on a good with low elasticities.

- If the government wants to change behaviour, tax a good with high elasticities.

- Taxing cigarettes to discourage smoking maybe ineffective
  - however, it can be used to gain revenue.
  
- Highly inelastic goods may suggest it's a necessity: people may be unhappy with the tax.

---

## Implication

- Same goes with the business people: be careful in increasing price if your product is highly elastically demanded.

- Next week, we will have a look a bit more detailed on the supply curve: 
  - what drives the elasticity of supply.
  - Different types of cost.
