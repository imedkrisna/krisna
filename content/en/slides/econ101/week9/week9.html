# Unemployment rate

---

## Unemployment rate: Definition

- Unemployment rate is NOT simply the rate of how many people without a job in a country.

- The important part is the divider: instead of dividing unemployed people with total population, we divide it with a **labour force**

.s[
`$$\text{unemployment rate}=\frac{\text{Number of unemployed workers}}{\text{Labour Force}} \times 100\%$$`
]
---

## Labour Force

- **labour force** is the sum of people who are **currently working** and people who are **looking for work**.

- Unemployment rate in Indonesia is calculated by BPS. You can read the definition [on their website](https://www.bps.go.id/subject/6/tenaga-kerja.html#subjekViewTab1).

- You need to be above 15 years old to be included in the labour force.

- **Currently working**: doing activities which receive payment or profit for at least 1 hour in 1 week.

---

## More definition

- **looking for work** is someone who are not working but reporting as looking for work in the last one week.

- **part-time employed** is someone who are doing work less than 35 hours a week and is **not** looking for a full-time work.

- **underemployed** is someone who are doing work less than 35 hours a week and is looking for a full-time work but unable to find one (mostly due to economic condition).

---

---

## labour force &amp; participation rate

Labour force excludes:

1. 15 years old or younger.
1. School and university goers.
1. Retiree.
1. stay-at-home mum/dad.

- Labour participation rate is defined as:

.s[$$\text{Labour Participation Rate}=\frac{\text{Labour Force}}{\text{Population over 15 years old}}$$]

---

## Labour Force Participation

- Even when population growth is small, it is possible to increase labour force participation.

- for example by having **more working women**: East Asian Miracle in the 1990s was partly because increased women's participation in the economy.

- More people going to the **universities** can also reduce labour participation rate for a while.

- **Migration** changes population and labour force participation in both source region and receiving region.

## Indonesia's Unemployment rate

- Indonesia had a very low unemployment rate during the 90s amid industrial expansion

- The 1998 Asian Financial Crisis (AFC) took a big hit on unemployment rate

- 2008 Global Financial Crisis (GFC) brings a lot of foreign investment, expanding the economy.

# Natural Rate of Unemployment

---

## Unemployment rate &amp; Growth

- It is intuitive to think that economic growth leads to lower unemployment rate.

- When business cycle is peaking, more jobs are available. Thus lowering unemployment rate.

- That is why you can name a law that improve business climate as "job creation law".

- But can we have a booming economy to a point where unemployment rate = 0?

--

- The answer is no

---

## Natural rate of unemployment

- Indonesia's lowest unemployment was during the manufacturing boom in the early 1991 at 2.62%.

- There are some reasons why we will never get unemployment to 0:

  + Structural change
  + Frictional unemployment
  + Structural unemployment
  
---

## Structural change

- When the economy booms, usually only a certain jobs become available.

- For example, the manufacturing boom in the 90s brought a lot of labour-intensive and engineering jobs.

---

Bulletin of Indonesian Economic Studies, 53:1, 1-25, DOI: 10.1080/00074918.2017.1326201]

---

## Structural change

- In the 2008, many investment goes to developing countries such as Indonesia.

- These investments are coming to many services-related sectors, not so much on agricultural sector.

- You might heard how many Indonesia's agricultural engineering graduates goes to the financial sectors.

- A person who are already a farmer can not easily jump to non-farming jobs.

---

## Frictional unemployment

- The graduates might take some times to do **job search**, and during this time, if that graduates is being surveyed, BPS will classify him/her as unemployed.

- This is called frictional unemployment.

- for example, an engineer graduates can easily join the online taxi wave, but one might skip that opportunity and keep searching for engineering jobs.

---

## Frictional unemployment

- It is not bad, in fact it is actually good because it shows that people look for jobs best suited to them.

- Good **job matching** is good for economy because it leads to efficiency.

- Problem arise when it takes too long and too costly for a job search to match.

---

## Structural unemployment

- Is when labour supply is persistently higher than available jobs.

- Structural unemployment happens when the job market cannot clear.

- This is due to a **price floor**-like effect which prevent wage to hit a **market clearing wage rate**.

- this is not great as it introduces inefficiency.

---

---

## Minimum wages

- Minimum wage is mandated by the government to ensure a decent wage for all worker.

- It has an opportunity cost:
  + potentially reduces work opportunity [(Suryahadi et al 2010)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00074910302007)
  + people who are willing to work in a lower wage can't participate
  + it helps only people who are already working
  
- Minimum wage can help in the situation where labour demand is concentrated on a small number of firms (employer has market power).

---

## Labour union

- Labour union can have a similar effect to a minimum wage

- Labour union allows for labours to act collectively, and negotiate a higher wage for the union members. (**collective bargaining**)

- Collective bargaining gives labour market power, and can potentially be harmful for unemployed people.

---

## Efficiency wages

- Firms may choose to pay **efficiency wage**, a wage that employers set above the equilibrium wage rate so employee has insentive to perform better.

- For employers, sometimes having a smaller number of employee is better as long as they are perform.

- This higher wage creates structural unemployment.

---

## The natural rate of unemployment

- Is the level of unemployment that is rendered "natural" (since it won't get to zero)

- Natural unemployment = frictional unemployment + structural unemployment.

- Actual unemployment = natural unemployment + cyclical unemployment.

- **Cyclical unemployment** is the deviation of the actual rate of unemployment from the natural rate because of economic cycle.

---

## The natural rate of unemployment

- Knowing the level of the natural rate of unemployment is important to determine the state of the economy.

- However, it is not always straight-forward: we don't always know what the natural rate of unemployment is and is always up to a debate.

- Moreover, just because someone has a job does not mean the job is decent or secure.

- A minimum wage too high can also incentivies **informal jobs** which has worse working condition compared to formal jobs.

# inflation

---

## Inflation

- A rise in price level is not necessarily bad, especially if wage level is also rises.

- Economists often use the term 'real' to negates the impact of price level and wage level.

- **real wage** is the level of wage divided by a price level, while **real income** is the level of income divided by a price level.

- They show the most important things: how much goods and services you can get from working and earning money.

---

## Inflation

- The rate at how fast the price increase can be a problem: that is, inflation.

- remember the definition of inflation:

.s[$$\text{inflation rate}=\frac{\text{Price index year 2 - Price index year 1}}{\text{Price index year 1}} \times 100\%$$]

- There are problems with inflation that is too high.

---

## Cost associated with inflation

- **menu cost**, is when firms need to change printed price on their menus or displays.

- During the Brazilian inflation of the early 1990s, supermarket workers are reportedly spent half their time for changing price stickers.

- **Unit-of-account cost** is a cost associated with unreliability of money. During a hyperinflation, it is common to ditch local currency and use US Dollar instead to buy and sell goods, like in Zimbabwe and Venezuela.

- In the worst-case scenario, barter can even be an option.

---

## Winner and losers from inflation

- The reason why inflation creates winners and losers is **long term contract**.

- Many transactions are not made in a single day: for example, a loan.

- In the case of loan, a borrower received a fixed amount of money today while having to return it with interest at a later time.

- The contract is usually written in a **nominal interest rate** term. High inflation can reduces the actual **real interest rate**.

- real interest rate = nominal interest rate - inflation.

---

## Winner and losers from inflation

- Suppose Ann borrow 200.000.000 IDR from Bob with 10% interest rate: Ann will return 220.000.000 to Bob in a year time. Ann use the money to buy a car.

- However, inflation is high: the next year's price of a car is actually 230.000.000 IDR, which is a 15% increase.

- In this case, real interest rate = 10% - 15% = -5%: it is better for Bob to buy car instead of lending the money to Ann.

- in other words, borrowers gain from inflation at the expense of lenders.

---

## Which inflation?

- It is common to calculate inflation using local currency.

- As an economic agent, we have expectation of the future and of the value of IDR.

- If we expect an inflation, perhaps it is better to save in terms of other asset: real estate, stock, foreign exchange, gold, cryptos etc.

- In the end, how much IDR we have is not the most important. The most important is how much things we can buy with thata amount of IDR.

---

## Inflation is hard

- Inflation can be problematic because it is hard to bring down once it reach a high number.

- Inflation can make a currency become too volatile and worthless as a unit of transaction.
  + especially if import is very high.

- In general, a central bank and the government target inflation to be at 2%.

## Next week

- We will learn more on economic growth.

- We will look at the relationship between inflation, unemployment rate and economic growth.
