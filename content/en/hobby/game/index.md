I’ve started playing video games less often. Currently, there are 3 games that I still play until now:

1. Guild Wars 2.  
2. Monster Hunter Wilds.  
3. Mobile Legends: Bang Bang.  

## Guild Wars 2  

I've always enjoyed playing MMORPGs, and Guild Wars 2 is one game I still play to this day. I’ve been playing this game for a long time—probably since I was in graduate school for my master’s degree. I play it on and off, and since this game doesn’t have vertical progression, it’s great for casual on-and-off gameplay. I main mesmer and mostly do PvE content.  

I play in the America region on the Dragonbrand server. Hit me up with my ID at Madboy.6804.  

## Monster Hunter Wilds  

It’s a new game, and I’ve been a fan of Monster Hunter for a long time. I mainly use the insect glaive and bow, but I also enjoy using the long sword. I was introduced to the series by my Filipino PhD colleague back when Monster Hunter World came out. That’s why when Wilds launched, I bought it immediately. However, my Pinoy friend and I have both been busy lately, so we haven’t had time to play together—haha.  

## Mobile Legends: Bang Bang  

As a former DotA player, I think it’s only natural that I eventually started playing this. Again, I play it on and off. I mostly play as support/roamer, occasionally filling in other lanes, but I definitely can’t handle assassin or jungle roles.
