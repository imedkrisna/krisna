Import substitution strategy is back in Indonesia. Well, not that it has ever left, but Indonesian government have new target now, that they would like to [reduce import by 35%](https://money.kompas.com/read/2020/08/21/214612026/kejar-target-substitusi-impor-35-persen-begini-strategi-pemerintah) by 2022. Some instruments that it is willing to use is a tariff to an extent, and some Non-Tariff Measures (NTMs) such as Local Content Requirements (LCRs). Indonesian government also mentioned about the need to still importing some capital goods and manufacturing inputs.

Will this be a good strategy though?

Interestingly, a new working paper by Douglas Irwin, [the rise and fall of import substitution](https://www.piie.com/publications/working-papers/rise-and-fall-import-substitution#:~:text=In%20the%201950s%2C%20many%20economists,economic%20growth%20in%20developing%20countries.&text=This%20paper%20traces%20the%20rise,substitution%20as%20a%20development%20idea.), discuss exactly that. The paper share a story on how import substitution strategy evolves in economics. In fact, there are prominent economists who are endorsing this strategy somewhere in 1950s.

After the world war II, some economists argue that free trade was not beneficial for developing nations. Free trade would force developing countries to specialised in primary goods, and import manufacturing goods. This would lead developing countries not able to grow their income and at disadvantage situation.

Prebisch is one of them
