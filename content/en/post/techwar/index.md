- Once the production is complete, the marginal cost for additional sale is zero: all you need to do is a copy paste, give product key, or give an access to the customer's account. Once the product is ready, the cost of servicing 100 or 10,000 customers is very similar.

local externality: break it. global externality: help it.

kapitalis bisa lebih powerful dari negara. bayangin klo kita trade pake gopay dan ga mau pake rupiah? Ant group disikat.
