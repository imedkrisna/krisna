This is a course I designed and teach for bachelor level students at International Business Engineering (IBE) program at Universitas Kristen Petra, 2$^{nd}$ semester of 2020/2021. I use Essentials of Economics[^1] (Krugman and Wells, 2016) as my guide. The book is chosen because it mainly includes many global business examples and very easy to follow for business students but also for non-economics programs in general. Some examples used in this course may be tailored a bit on Indonesian context.

Some additional resources include Introduction of Economic Analysis by McAfee and Lewis[^2] (2009) and various journal articles and news articles.

## About this course
This course teaches the basic principle of economics. It is designed to provide non-economics student about how economists make decisions under scarcity. Covered are essential principles such as the consumer and firm problem, market and its failure, and basic strategic thinking. We also explore the macro perspective of economics and see how governments make decisions.

## Learning outcomes

2.	To understand market failure, where perfect market principles may not work.

4.	To understand reasoning behind macroeconomic policies.

## Prior knowledge
