# About economics

---

## Why economics?

- Contrary to what normal people think, economics is not about (just) money.
- Economics is all about making optimal decision under scarcity.
- We use math principle to optimise our decision making.
- This course is not going to dig too deep into the world of economic principles.
- This course does not provide answers to your question: It teach how to use economic framework to shape your question.

---

## Some questions asked by economists

- How to best tackle climate change?
- Is minimum wage good?
- Should we introduce tax holiday to firms?
- Should the government increase expenditure by more tax or more debt?
- Should we introduce Universal Basic Income?
- How to evaluate government program?
- Should we ban mineral export?
- can we sustain economic growth?
- what to do during economic crisis?

---

## More questions can be answered with (partially) economic principles

- lockdown or not lockdown?
- Should we invest in testing and tracing? or should we invest in treatment?
- Who to vaccine first: the elderly and vulnerables, or the working age?
- Should we trust BUMN, or private sector?
- essentially, it's about tradeoffs, cost and benefit.

---

### About your learning

- To get a glimpse of what economists usually do, you can take a look at my blog. examples:
  - [Consumption-saving decision]({{< relref "post/surga" >}})
  - [how to set the price on toll road]({{< relref "post/jorr" >}})
  - [FDI, trade and industry policy (in Indonesian)]({{< relref "post/hitektrade" >}})

-  Questions you might be interested in:
   - should I expand to other market or continue serving my niche?
   - Should I outsource or make our own?
   - Recruit fresh grads or train high school graduates?
   - Update current system or adapt new system?

# Principles of Economics üí∞

---

### People make choices

##### because resources are scarce

- resource can be anything you use to produce.

- Money is the most mainstream limited resource.
  - Buy only one holiday package.
  - Buy only one portion of nasi goreng.

- But there are other resources worth noting.
  - There's only one holiday season in a year.
  - Two nasi gorengs would be too much for my stomach.

---

### The true cost of something is its opportunity cost

- money is just one type of cost.
- The true cost of taking a holiday to Hong Kong is going somewhere else.
- Your holiday can be spent on learning new stuff.
- What is the cost of doing your degree?
  - Going straight to work and get experiences.
  - Doing other degrees (biology, chemistry, etc).
  - enjoy life.
- essentially, opportunity cost of something is something else you gave up to get it.

---

### Pop quiz

<iframe src="https://embed.polleverywhere.com/multiple_choice_polls/27Z726hL5mMDWeaKsBbDQ?controls=none&short_poll=true" width="800px" height="600px"></iframe>

---

### Thinking at the margin

- The principle of opportunity cost leads to a marginal thinking.
- Understand your status quo, and think what action you can do to add a little improvement from it.
- If you have two hours to study or play, how will you divide it?
  - what if there's an exam tommorow?
  - If you are tired of studying, would you study more?

---

### Specialisation and gains from trade

- During your daily time, you make decisions on allocating how much time to study and to cook, among other things.
- Since you will die if you don't eat, you can't allocate 0 hour to cook.
- On the other hand, there are those who are very good cook and will cook for you for a little money.
- In this case, it may be better if you spend 0 hour to cook, and order food from these chefs.
- Trade is the reason why I can study economics: I don't have to study how to be a doctor. I will just go to the hospital if I need a medical service.

---

### Specialisation and gains from trade

- Extending to firm level, many outsource part of their business from a third party.
  - buying {{< icon name="microsoft" pack="fab" >}}office probably better than developing our own softwares.
  - why make our own server if we can use {{< icon name="aws" pack="fab" >}}?
  - Use tokopedia instead of making your own e-store.

- We can easily extend this to a country level:
  - Japan makes car because they cannot plant palm oil.

---

### Incentives matter

- People move to cities because there are more opportunities there.
- People will buy cheaper products given the same price.
- incentives are not always about money:
  - You study more on the subjects you like.
    
> *"ada gula ada semut"*

---

### Market and intervention

- often times, market incentives are enough.
- However, intervention is often used.
  - education is an example where government intervene heavily.
  - Gojek used subsidy to incentivies drivers and users.
- Intervention may be temporary.
  - The COVID-19 relieve bill (PEN) will likely stop after the pandemic.
  - Gojek's subsidy is removed once they reach economies of scale.

---

### Things tend to move to equilibrium

- When there is an incentive to do something, there will be more and more people exploit it.
- As more people do it, the incentive decreases to a point where it is not worth it anymore.
- examples:
  - City becomes more crowded (and costly to live in).
  - Stock price stops growing few moments after its IPO.
  - Countries' economic growth reduced after they get rich.
- Movement towards equilibrium, however, varies.
  - short run vs long run.
  - individual vs aggregate.
  
---

### Conclusion

- We will see how these principles come up again and again as we delve deeper into the course.
- The principle will be carried over to your overall degree, and life in general.
- I am not trying to make you an economist, but the principles are very useful.
