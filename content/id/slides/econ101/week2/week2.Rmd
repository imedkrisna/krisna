# Supply and demand

- COVID-19 and trade war cause demand and supply shocks
  
  - Demand for electronices rose up, while supply can hardly keep-up

- Supply, demand and price are important to making decision.

  - high price incentivies producer to expand, hence lower price.

---

# Market

- Chip makers and chip users create the market for chip.

- Market is a "place" where buyers and sellers meet to exchange goods and services for payment.

- When there are 'many' buyers and 'many' sellers, we often say the maket is **competitive**.

- How many is 'many'? 100? 1.000?

---

# Competitive market

- The important feature of competitive market is power.

- In the competitive market, buyer and seller cannot control price.

  - Seller trying to sell above market price won't get any buyer, vice versa.
  
- Competitive market is also known as **perfect market** or **perfect competition**.

---

class: middle

# Competitive market

- Competitive market is characterised by low entry and exit cost.
  - It is easy to start production or file for bankruptcy.

- On the other extreme, there is **monopoly**, where the buyer/seller have absolute power.

- Most markets are somewhere in between.
  
---

# Competitive market

- As previously discussed, we analyze with model.

- While no market is exactly perfect, we always start with competitive market.

  - Like all model, we start with something simple.
  
  - as we move forward, we will see the implication of relaxing the perfect market assumption.

# Demand curve

## demand & price in 

#### a competitive market

---

# Demand

- Demand is the consumer side of the market, measured by quantity.
  
- It is generally accepted that people buy less goods if it is expensive, *ceteris paribus* <sup>1</sup>.

- People say this is the **law of demand**.

- economists usually measure this using the **demand schedule** & **demand curve**.

.footnote[
[1]: All other things being equal.
]

---

class: middle, center

# Intermezzo

#### Is *ceteris paribus* realistic?

What makes it hard to say exactly high price decrease demand?

---

# Demand schedule

- A demand schedule is a table showing how much people will want to buy a certain product given prices.

- If everyone in a country face the same price, we can measure demand by adding up all demand for a given price.

- Making a demand schedule is not easy, in part because *ceteris paribus* isn't realistic.
  - prices change, but so other things.

# Demand curve

- We can illustrate the demand schedule in a graph.

- A High school reminder of a Cartesian diagram:
  - Two planes, $x$ (horizontal) and $y$ (vertical).
  - $y=f(x)$
  
- We plot price on the y-axis, and quantity on the x-axis.
  - however, perfect market implies $Q^D=f(P)$

# Demand curve

### High school reminder

- Change in price leads to change in quantity along the lines.

- We say **quantity is a function of price**

$$
Q^D=f(P)
$$
- Price is exogenous, quantity is endogenous.
  - quantity does not affect price.
  - That's why perfect market is convinient.

# Demand curve

- There are plenty of things affect demand:
  - increased income, change of taste, influencers, etc.

- Additionally, prices change too:
  - Technology, disaster, tax, etc.
  
- As long as the change doesn't cause by buyers & sellers.
- When this happen, we shift the curve.

# Key take away

- We use graph to show relationship between price and quantity.

- In perfect competitive market, buyers and sellers can't affect price. Hence price is **exogenous** and quantity is **endogenous**.

- Change in price $\Rightarrow$ movement along the curve.

- Change in everything else $\Rightarrow$ shift the curve.

---

# Back to demand

- Shift the curve is what generally means by economist when we say **increase in demand** or **decrease in demand**.
  - i.e., at the same price point, demand change.

- What shift the demand curve?
  - Changes in the prices of related goods.
  - Changes in income.
  - Changes in taste.
  - Changes in expectations.
  - Changes in the number of consumers.

# What shifts the demand curve?

## Finding This out is your job as a businessman!

---

#### Changes in the prices of related goods or services

- Most normal goods have a **substitutes**.

- A Substitute is another good which serve the same purpose.
  - you will not likely to buy it if you have your main good.
  
- Bread, noodle, and pasta can be considered a substitute for rice. What else?

- When $P_{noodle}$ goes down, you might want to switch to noodle, hence reducing demand for rice even when $P_{rice}$ doesn't change.

---

#### Changes in the prices of related goods or services

- The opposite of substitute is **complements** $^2$

- Demand is reduced if its complement is also reduced in demand.

- Demand for combustion engine car reduced when gasoline (*bensin*) prices go up.
  - similarly, people tend to buy electric car if charging it is relatively cheaper.

.footnote[[2]: not compliment. different word]

---

#### Changes in income

- In most goods, people buy more when their income increases.
  - that's why businesses pay attention to a country's economic growth.
  
- Most goods are **normal goods**, not **inferior goods**.

- **inferior goods** behave the other way around: buy less when income goes up.
  - you buy less of instant noodle when you're richer.

---

#### Changes in tastes.

- Changes in taste is straightforward.
  - nobody listens to K-Pop back in the 90s.

- We don't know how, but people's taste is changing.
  - Marketers and advertisers would like to disagree.
  
- If you can detect changes in tastes, or even better, influence other people's taste, you have an advantage in business!
  
---

#### Changes in expectations.

- People reacts on signal and what they expect for the future.

- Some people hold back purchasing some goods because they know those goods will have a discount in the near future.

- People buy more stocks when vaccine introduced cuz they expect the economy to grow in the near future.

- Knowledge is an advantage
  - that's why insider trading is illegal.

---

#### Changes in the number of buyer

- Similar with income, more buyer means more demand given the same price.

- This is why *warteg* often gets higher demand when there is a new construction site nearby.

- As the number of middle-class increases, demand for things that they usually buy also increase.

# Supply & Prices

# Supply

- Is the other side of the market.

- Like demand but the opposite:
  - Supply goes up when prices goes up.
  - When surgical facemask's price went up, even [Polytron supplies facemasks](https://www.tokopedia.com/tokosinarbarujakarta/masker-kesehatan-polytron-3ply?src=topads).
  
- We also express supply with **supply schedule** and **supply curve**.

  dark_theme_bw(base_size=20)+

```

---

# Supply Curve

- When price changes, quantity supplied go up.

- like demand, if sellers can't affect the market price, they follow the market price.

$$
Q^S=f(P)
$$
- the difference is, prices positively correlated with $Q^S$, $i.e.,$ $\frac{dQ^S}{dP} > 0$, $i.e.,$ upward sloping.

- Hence, $P$ is exogen, $Q^s$ is endogen.

# Supply curve

- Plenty of things that are not prices also affects the supply curve.

- Affecting farmers' decision to supply includes:
  - change in import price.
  - change in minimum  wage in manufacturing.
  - Draught or flood.
  - Adoption in tech, etc.
  - we'll learn more about production cost later.

- When these changes, we shift the curve.

## What shifts the supply curve?

- Like demand, there are several generelised factors affecting the supply curve.

- They are:
  - Changes in input prices
  - Changes in the prices of related goods or services
  - Changes in technology
  - Changes in expectations
  - Changes in the number of producers
  
---

#### Changes in input prices

- To produce, you need inputs
  - labour, seeds, fertilizers, price of land.

- $P_{input} \uparrow \enspace \Rightarrow$ Increase in production cost.
  - needs higher price to supply same amount of goods.

- In a sense, a producer in a market may be a consumer in another market.

  - A Factory outlet is a producer in the shirt market, but a consumer in the fabric market.
  
---

#### Changes in the prices of related goods or services

- Especially important for producers which sell many types of products with a very similar inputs.

- Toyota produces a lot of Avanza in Indonesia.
  - taxes for sedan and utility vehicles is higher in Indonesia.
  - You won't see Avanza in Australia. Instead, there's a lot of Camries and Hiluxes.
  
---

#### Changes in expectation

- Suppliers also tend to react to expectation.
  
- When a producer think there will be increase in price of its good in the future, it will hold to sell it.

- In fact, hoarding is a part of a producer's strategy.

- There's a trade-off between selling it now vs storing it and sell it later. 

---

#### Changes in the number of sellers

- Similar with income, more seller means more supply given the same price.

- The rise of Gojek and the likes leads to higher supply of transportation service.

- Similarly when China started to rise up in manufacturing: more supply for cheap labour for electronic industry.

# Perfect market equilibrium

---

# Market equilibrium

- Now that we learn that buyer and seller react to price on a curve, it is time to unite them!

- The perfect market is when quantity supplied matches quantity demanded.

$$ Q^D=Q^S $$
- The price that causes this is called **equilibrium price** or **market clearing price**.

- The easiest way is to graph the two Q together.

# Market equilibrium

.s[
- If price is **above market price**, there will be excess supply. Many goods are left unsold as the price isn't worth it for some buyers.

- Some of the less competitive supplier will close, driving price down.

- If price is **below market price**, there will be excess demand. Not enough goods are supplied and there will be **scarcity** in the market. People will try to sell more as producers increase production.

- sometimes it is even worth it to invest. Many alcohol producer turns to making hand sanitiser. Also, Polytron.

# Market equilibrium

- Price equilibrium may take some time to adjust.

- Some Markets are constantly moving (stock price is a good example)

- Shocks to demand and/or supply will move market equilibrium to a new position.

- **New market equilibrium** basically means a new equilibrium price and equilibrium quantity is formed.

## Equilibrium after shock

- A positive demand shock leads to a higher equilibrium quantity and price.

- A positive supply shock leads to a higher equilibrium quantity but a lower price.

- A negative demand shock leads to a lower equilibrium quantity and price, and lower equilibrium quantity with a higher price.

# Double positive shocks

- As you can see, if the positive shock is big enough, it can offset the rise in price with even higher increase in demand.

- You might note as well that the slope of the curve matters.
  - steeper curve change quantity even more.
  
- We will learn more later on **elasticity**.

---

# Perfect market

- So we learned a bit on how perfect market operates:
  - Supply and demand will eventually settle on a market clearing price.
  - Market clearing price adjust quickly.
  - No single buyer or seller can affect it.
  
- Movement along the curve occurs when price change

- while exogenous shock (non-price change) shifts the curve.

---

# Next week

- What happens when market prices doesn't adjust as quickly?

- What happens when the government intervene in a perfect market?

- We will learn tomorrow in:
