## About today

- Some intro
- Various ways data is presented
- Some stats
- Economic data
- Q&A

I assume y'all have never worked with data before  
I try to allocate more for Q&A

---

# Intro

---

## Why?

- Efficient & powerful to support your **story**.
  - you don't really need to be a math&stat-savy.

- Shows how good you are in understanding an issue.

- Objective, most of the time.

- Everyone use 'em these days. Tough luck for data haters.

---

# Data is getting mainstream

## Some of my fave data source

- For trade, UN Comtrade [https://comtrade.un.org/data/](https://comtrade.un.org/data/).
- General economic data, World Bank's World Development Indicators [https://data.worldbank.org/](https://data.worldbank.org/).
- Bank Indonesia (just google ["SEKI Bank Indonesia"](https://www.bi.go.id/id/statistik/ekonomi-keuangan/seki/Default.aspx)).
- BPS (either hit [https://www.bps.go.id/](https://www.bps.go.id/) or query your keyword in google + 'BPS').
- ask them researchers.

---

## Some jargons

- Cross-sectional data: contains a snapshot of many subjects/individuals (people, countries, firms, etc) in a given time.

- Time-series data: one subject observed for a long(-ish) periods of time.
  - Good if trend is important.

- Panel data: combination of the two.

---

# Various ways data is presented

---

## Cartesian plane

- A 2-dimensional plane.
  - pay attention to the x & y axis
  
- Generally 2 forms: bar/column and line.

- line chart is perfect for time series data.
  - usually x=time, y=value. [ex](https://tradingeconomics.com/indonesia/gdp)

- bar chart usually for cross-section data.
  - can be for time series too if you have one individual. [ex](https://www.statista.com/statistics/421169/most-followers-instagram/)

- on values: check out the units!
  
---

## Tables

- Not the best visualization but very flexible. (ex)[https://comtrade.un.org/data/]
  - easy to costumize with templates & other viz.
  - can store many variables.
  
- The most mainstream tools are microsoft excel & Google sheet.
  - Hence It's best to have a `.csv` or `.xlsx` or something similar.

- I certainly prefer working with these formats (among others)

---

## Tables

- First row is usually shows variables.
- Note that a machine-readable tables are the best!
  - i.e., it is better to have one row for variables.
- Example of [bad machine-readability](https://www.bps.go.id/indicator/5/2123/1/rata-rata-pengeluaran-perkapita-seminggu-menurut-kelompok-makanan-minuman-jadi-per-kabupaten-kota.html)

---

## Units in the X, Y and columns

- Never lose sight of the units of your value.
  - e.g., thousand or millions, kg or ton, etc.

- Especially important if you use various data source.
  - BI's trade data is in 1000USD while Comtrade's in USD.

- Always read what's X and Y.
  - if you make the graph, always write what's X and Y.

---

# Some statistics

---

## The need to aggregate

- How to process an information of the income of 1 million people?

- When we have data of 1 million people, it's impractical to look at 1 million values.

- We look for one number that represent these 1 million values.
  - this is usually the average (or mean).

- We also need to understand how the value is distributed.
  - called standard deviation.

---

## Normal distribution

- If we group values, take frequency, then sort them, we can make a distribution plot.

- We can make a smooth approximation of the distribution plot with functions.

- The most famous distribution is the **normal distribution**

- Normal distribution's characteristics:
  - frequency is highest around the mean
  - the tail is skinny (i.e., frequency is very small in the extremes)

---

---

## When to use median

- Median is the value lying in the middle of the whole group if we sort the value.

- If we have 1 million people:
  - Sort their income from lowest to highest.
  - Median is the income of the 500.000th person.

- Median is often use in the presence of non-trivial number of extreme values (i.e., fat tail).

- income is often not distributed normally, so median is better.

- example in excel.

# Economic data

---

## Real vs nominal

- We use currency to express many economic variables.

- We can't aggregate car + food.
  -  we can 200 million + 50 thousand.

- But really what we want is the car and the food, not the money.

- We need to take into account change in prices (i.e., inflation)

---

## Real vs nominal

- Say a firm can make 1 car and 100 food in 2020.

- The firm's GDP is $1 \times 200 + 100 \times 0.05 = 205$

- in 2021, car's price is increase to 210, hence GDP becomes 215.

- Increased GDP?
  - not really, cuz the firm still just produced 1 car and 100 food.

---

## Real vs nominal

- It's easy to imagine the complexity of this stuff in reality.

- One thing is clear though: we want to exclude increase in GDP from price effect.

- To avoid price effect, we use 2020 price so we can compare 2020 GDP with 2021 GDP.

- Real GDP = When we use old prices.

---

## Real vs nominal

- Obviously to keep comparing, we still need to use 2020 prices when we calculate 2022 GDP.

- also when we calculate GDP in 2023, etc.

- Because we keep using 2020 prices, we say 'constant price'.
  - 2020 is called 'reference year'.
  - nominal GDP is calculate using 'current price'.
  - nominal GDP = constant real GDP in the reference year.

- The constant price changes from time to time.
  
---

## GDP vs GDP per capita

- GDP is an aggregate of the whole economy.
  - used to show how big & important the country is.

- GDP per capita is the mean/average
  - used to reflect living standard & productivity.

- Singapore vs Indonesia: rich vs powerful.

---

## Fraction

- Fraction is usually expressed with percent.

- We use fraction to express how important an individual is to the group/population.

- India imports 3.05 billion USD of CPO from Indonesia doesn't say a lot.
  - India imports 61% of its CPO from Indonesia says how important supplier Indonesia is.
  - From Malaysia ~32%, FYI.

---

## Percent change / growth

- Growth is important to reflect how fast something is changing.

- Percent change is nice cuz it's unit-free.

- It linearizes non-linear thing, which's good and bad.

- If your income drop by 50% today, will 50% increase tomorrow get you back to your old income?

---

## Index

- Index is prolly the most confusing thing.

- Index can be in many forms with many different weight.
  - sometimes you might need to check its formula.
  - the purpose of index is still to give us one representative number to reflect the big picture.

- For example, consumer price index (CPI) calculates a change in price level of many consumer goods.

- [Indeks Kedalaman Kemiskinan](https://www.bps.go.id/subject/23/kemiskinan-dan-ketimpangan.html#subjekViewTab1) shows how deep the poverty of some area is.

---

## A note on CPI and similar indices

- CPI and many other indicies are shown in number near 100.

- That's because CPI is calculated as compared to 100.
  - 100 is the 'base', the year where CPI=100 is called reference year.

- [For example](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/FP.CPI.TOTL?end=2021&locations=ID&start=1999), if CPI in 2010=100 while 2020=154, that means prices in 2020 is 54% higher than 2010.
