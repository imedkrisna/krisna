title: "Cover Music Video on Youtube"
subtitle: ""
summary: "I did some cover videos with my friends. The collaboration is done completely online, which is very convinient since COVID-19 requires measures of physical distancing and we have no plan violating those measures. I mainly sing in these vids while also play some instruments. It is also fun to learn a bit of mixing although my mixing skill is really crappy."
