- Indonesia recent NDCs vow to reduce emissions by 31.9% (CM1) and 43.2% (CM2)[^1] in 2030, net-zero emission (NZE) in 2050.

- From those, energy emission must reduced by 12.5% and 15.5% respectively.

- Financing will be a challenge, as it requires [3,500 Trilion IDR](https://ebtke.esdm.go.id/post/2020/08/24/2613/turunkan.emisi.314.juta.ton.co2.tahun.2030.indonesia.perlu.investasi.rp.3.500.triliun#:~:text=%22Pemerintah%20telah%20mencanangkan%20target%20penurunan%20emisi%20gas%20rumah,2030%20dengan%20estimasi%20kebutuhan%20investasi%20sebesar%20Rp3.500%20triliun.)

- Electrification is central to the Indonesian effort toward the climate goals:

    - EVs, induction stove[@budy].

- Grid is very coal dominated, but that's cuz it's cheap[@paul2].

- Transitioning will be costly, but electricity price will also go up.

- May impact the already low energy consumptions.

## The targets

According to @budy, @memr, @memr2 and @moef @ember:

  - 52% total PLN's electricity by renewables in 2030.
  
  - In 2040, no more coal: full renewable electricity.
  
  - In 2030, 64% electricity will be generated by Independent Power Producers (IPP)
    
  - Lots and lots of EV and induction stoves.

## The PLN {.m}

:::: columns
::: {.column width=44%}

![Electricity produced by source (GWh) source: @pln](sumber.png)

:::
::: {.column width=55%}

- Indonesian electricity sector is heavily regulated and PLN is the sole distributor.

- Prices are layered with household (44.78% of total consumers) typically pays the least, followed, industries (31.4%), business (17.25%), and then the government (6.57%) [@pln].

- Renewable is still very small, dominated by Hydro (11TWh), Geothermal (4TWh), and very little solar (5GWh).

- PLN can't increase price & must cut subsidy. Thus, rely on coal.

:::
::::


## The IPP

- Independen Power Producers (IPPs) will play a bigger role:

    - now 36.79%, in 2030 will be 64% [@memr]

- Growth of renewable mainly comes from IPP solar and HH rooftop: of total 225MW solar capacity, only 9% is PLN-owned.

- PLN cannot freely switch prices: it cannot increase price to consumers who buys electricity from expensive producers.

- Uncertainty on land use and procurement are problems.

## The Carbon market

- The Indonesian government leads the effort with the creation of Emission Trading System (ETS).

- The government will set a carbon cap to polluters. If a firm needs to pollute more than the cap, they must purchase permit from firms which pollute less or got taxed.

- In a perfectly functioning market, this is efficient. Govt can also reduce cap each year little by little.

- The price at the moment is hovering around 60-70k IDR/kgCO2 (around 4USD). Compare with foreigners? [Still too cheap](https://carboncredits.com/carbon-prices-today/).

- What if NDCs are met?

- How much emission can we reduce, how much electricity is going to cost under different scenarios.

- Should we retire coal? Or should we keep using coal but retire everything else and speed up renewables?

- I use linear system by first assume a perfect substitution between 3 sources of energy: renewables, coal, and other fossil fuels.

:::
::::

## Model setting {.m}

- Let $p \cdot w$ be a total cost of generating electricity (in Watt hour) from 3 sources: clean $(w_a)$, coal $(w_b)$, and less carbon-y fossil fuels $(w_g)$

- We add emission constraint to this standard cost minimization problem with $a,b,g=$ emission factor of its respective energy source

- We then get a completely linear system:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\min_{W} \ &  p \cdot w \\
\mbox{subject to } \ & w_a+ w_b+ w_g \ge \omega \\
 & aw_a+bw_b+gw_g \le \varepsilon \\
 & w_a,w_b,w_g \ge 0\\
\end{aligned}
$$

## Model setting

- Cost optimization allows for a compensating variation calculatin [@cowell].

- Perfect substitution have important implications:

    - Perfect changes in electricity mix reflects a longer run scenario.
    
    - The cost of substitution isn't reflected by the model.
    
    - Short-run constraint can be modeled by setting boundaries on the possible solution.
    
## Parameterization

- Electricity price from @pln where $p_g \approx p_a \approx 2p_b$

- $\omega$ from @pln, but the share is from @ember.

- Emission factor is calibrated from @febijanto10 and @jrc.

    - renewable has small factor from procuring solar PV.
    
## Scenarios {.s}

| case | description | model setting |
| --- | ---------- | ------------- |
| 1 | status quo | restricting the current share of generation. |
| 2 | current emission, optimized | case 1 without source restriction. |
| 3 | carbon tax | Same emission limit but with a carbon tax |
| 4 | CM1 | same prices but a 12.5% emission reduction |
| 5 | CM2 | same prices but a 15.5% emission reduction |
| 6 | New RUPTL | case 2 with 52% renewables |
| 7 | Zero coal | case 2 with 0% coal |
| 8 | Fully renewable | case 2 with 100% renewables |

## Discussions

- Corner solution toward coal corroborate Indonesia's reliance on coal.

- Case 3: 50% increase in price -> 18.26% total cost, trivial emission reduction.

- Carbon quota (CM1,CM2) increase cost less than carbon tax.

- 0 coal $\rightarrow$ 37.72% extra cost, 100% renewable $\rightarrow$ 41.75%

- Note this does not account for the transition cost.

## Discussions {.m}

- Coal is central to cost reduction (and reliability). It may be hard to retire coal.

    - caveat: parameter-sensitive

- Updated parameter is important: can the price of solar go lower in the future?

- Since PLN is slow, enabling IPP will be key:

    - Barriers for them include uncertainty on procurement and the use of TKDN.
    
- Floating PV may be a partial solution to lower renewable cost.

- Carbon market is only as efficient as its institution. Can it endure the test of time?

## Conclusions

- It is shown that greening the grid is central to achieve Indonesia's NDCs

- Given vast majority of its users are HH and industry, rising cost can be a huge problem.

- A linear substitution model shows electricity prices can potentially rise to more than 37%

- Early-retiring coal may be too ambitious, and enabling IPPs to grow renewable is necessary.
