  abstract = {The pledge to reduce emission has reached a new height
    globally, and Indonesia is no exception. According to Indonesiaâ€™s
    latest NDCs, it vowed to reduce emission by 31.9\% to 43.2\%. One of
    the key for Indonesia to reduce its emission is electrification,
    which makes greening the grid a priority for the Indonesian
    government. However, Indonesia has been relying heavily on coal
    while the growth of renewable is slow. A linear optimization
    technique show that cleaning the indonesian electricity sector from
    coal leads to a potential increase in cost by 37\%. The key to
    reduce this cost increase is by enabling the Indonesian independent
    power producers, which grow their electricity generation much faster
    than the state owned company. The government must improve the
    efficiency of procurement, improve its pricing, and forego local
    content requirements, if it wants to achieve its emission target.}
