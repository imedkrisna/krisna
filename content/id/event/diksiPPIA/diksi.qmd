## About RCEP

- The impact from tariff is negligible: about [0.07% higher real income](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/06/15/america-is-losing-ground-in-asian-trade) from World Bank's estimate.

- The gain will come from the new Rules of Origin (RoO): The one region RoO rules.

- This new RoO will improve the region's ability to produce, as supply chain will be much more streamlined.

- Many countries in the region are preparing an action plan to shape each government's strategy to utilise RCEP.

- Other parts of the agreement seems watered down, however.

## ASEAN EV

- ASEAN [declaration](https://asean.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/07-ASEAN-Leaders-Declaration-on-Developing-Regional-EV-Ecosystem_adopted.pdf).
