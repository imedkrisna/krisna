## Course description

This course is taught in the economics undergraduate program at Universitas Indonesia (UI). This is a 14-week course and I co-deliver it with [Kiki Verico](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kiki-verico-313a8033/?originalSubdomain=id) (the guy needs no introduction. If you don't know him it's on you). I cover the first 7 while KV the last 7. This sites contain my side of the delivery. The first 7 focuses on updating you with trade theory, from the most primitive to currency. Last 7 covers trade policies and movement of capitals (finance stuff).

This course is intended to provide a fundamental understanding of the basics of international economics. Essentially, international economics can be divided into the economics of international trade and the economics of international finance. In both streams, we cover theories and policies in international trade and international finance. In international trade, we study why countries trade with each other, what determine trade patterns, and how 2 countries gain from trade. In international finance, we study the flows of capital between countries, how exchange rate is determined, and how countries gain from movement of capital.
