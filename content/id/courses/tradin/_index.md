## Description

The course of Trade and Industrial Economic Development Analysis aims to understand how trade and industrial activities contribute to overall economic growth and development. This course also discusses the dynamics of trade and industrial development, as well as the challenges and opportunities they present for firms, policymakers, and overall economies. Students are expected to understand theories and be able to analyse various aspects, such as trade and industrial patterns, composition and implementation, and their relation to employment and labor, innovation and technology, investment and capital flow, productivity and efficiency, supply chains, policy impacts, global market integration, as well as sustainability and environment impacts.

## Learning outcomes

-   Understand the principle behind the gains from trade and industrial development.

-   Able to explain various tools for the government to achieve trade and industrial policy goals.

-   Understand tools for trade and industry analytics.

The course of Trade and Industrial Economic Development Analysis aims to understand how trade and industrial activities contribute to overall economic growth and development. This course also discusses the dynamics of trade and industrial development, as well as the challenges and opportunities they present for firms, policymakers, and overall economies.

The structure of the course is straightforward: the first 7 meetings will cover more theoretical part of the course. That is, the gains from trade, market failure in industrial development, and the development of the new industrial policies. A wee bit of microfinance will be covered too.

The remaining 7 meetings covers the more practical side of the course. A more practical tool for industrial and trade analyses currently used in the industry will be covered, along with various trade and industry policies currently in place. Lastly, we cover empirical evidence and strategies on issues covered in the theoretical part.

## Prior

We assume you are well-versed already at this point on the core theory of microeconomics and macroeconomics. In particular, we assume you are all familiar with first and second welfare theorem as well as the consequences of market imperfection. You should be comfortable with growth theory especially in the open economy context, particularly balance of payment and interest rate parity concept.

We expect students are comfortable with entry level math like simple linear algebra and optimization as discussed in Microeconomics.

It will be extremely helpful if you’re already taken international economics. We will cover a bit comparative advantage and new growth theory at the beginning but will not revisit too many international finance.
