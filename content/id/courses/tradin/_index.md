## Prior

We assume you are well-versed already at this point on the core theory of microeconomics and macroeconomics. In particular, we assume you are all familiar with first and second welfare theorem as well as the consequences of market imperfection. You should be comfortable with growth theory especially in the open economy context, particularly balance of payment and interest rate parity concept.

We expect students are comfortable with entry level math like simple linear algebra and optimization as discussed in Microeconomics.

It will be extremely helpful if you’re already taken international economics. We will cover a bit comparative advantage and new growth theory at the beginning but will not revisit too many international finance.
