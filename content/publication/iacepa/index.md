abstract: "IA-CEPA excited everyone when it was taken into effect, a result of 10 years long of negotiations between two great neighbours in the region. It is hoped that the economic relation between the two can be synergized and hopefully improve interdependency which then strengthen political relationship as well. We are sceptical that IACEPA would economically matter at least in the short to medium term, but celebrates the right step taken between both countries. See the complete publication in [Indonesia at Melbourne's website](https://indonesiaatmelbourne.unimelb.edu.au/will-ia-cepa-be-the-boost-to-the-australia-indonesia-relationship-leaders-are-banking-on/)"
