# Introduction

- However, Protectionism is on the rise, including in Indonesia (Patunru 2018)

- While overall tariff went down, Non-Tariff Measures went up

- The role of Ministry of Industry is on the rise from National Standards (SNI) and Local Content Requirement (LCR) (Munadi 2018)

- Pandemic accelerates the trend, potentially using tariff as well
> "Roadmap sedang disusun. Nanti output-nya **subtitusi impor** pada akhir **2022** sebesar **35%**," kata Menteri Perindustrian Agus Gumiwang dalam sebuah webinar, Selasa (28/7).

- Protectionism policies may lead to more policies:
 - US Case: iron $\Rightarrow$ appliances
 - Indonesian Case: corn & soybean $\Rightarrow$ chicken, mobile phone

# Introduction

- The straight forward question:

> To what extent tariff and NTM affects firm's productivity?

- Further investigation is conducted:

 - does size matters? (core question since Melitz (2003))
 
 - how protectionism affects employment?
 
 - can NTM reduces firm's import in general?
 
- Building from Amiti and Konnings (2007), I estimate TFP and use it as dependent variable

- Tariff is scrapped from MoF regulations, NTM from TRAINS database

- Other databases: Survey Industri and Customs data from BPS from 2008 to 2012

# Firms

- Survey Industri (SI), BPS
  - follows many Indonesian manufacturing since 1970s
  - infos include factor used, foreign ownership, output, fraction of export and import
  - unbalanced, unfortunately
  - Inconsistent fixed asset and energy consumption
  
- Customs data
  - 2008-2012 with firm id to integrate with SI
  - varies with countries and HS-8-digit
  - not exactly match one-on-one with SI
  - can't say for sure if the import is directly used for production

- Not all firms reporting export and import in SI exist in the customs data, and vice-versa
  - may be using third party

## Trade Policies

##### Tariff
- Tariff is scrapped from Ministry of Finance's regulations from 2008 to 2012.
- For practicality, also used are source from FTA partners.
- FTAs during 2008-2012 includes with ASEAN, China, Japan, South Korea, India, Australia and New Zealand.

##### NTMs
- TRAINS (UNCTAD 2017) is used for NTM
- Count data (=1 if an NTM is applied to a good in HS-6-Digit)
  - neutral, but lack depth
- Doesn't really follow (cross section)
  - but do have `Start Date` and `End Date`

# TFP estimation

The framework is using two-stage regression:  
first, estimating TFP

$$y_{it}=\beta_0 + \beta_ll_{it}+\beta_kk_{it}+\beta_mm_{it}+\beta_nn_{it}+\epsilon_{it}$$
where:  
$y_{it}$  &nbsp; = Revenue of firm i at time t  
$l_{it}$  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= number of labour  
$k_{it}$ &nbsp; = fixed assets  
$m_{it}$ &nbsp;= intermediate materials  
$n_{it}$ &nbsp; = energy consumption

Use the coefficient to predict TFP:

$$TFP_{it}=y_{it}-\hat{\beta}_{l}l_{it}-\hat{\beta}_kk_{it}-\hat{\beta}_mm_{it}-\hat{\beta}_nn_{it}$$
then estimate the second stage:

$$TFP_{it}=\gamma_0+\gamma_{tariff}tariff_{it}+\gamma_{NTM}NTM_{it}+\eta_{it}$$

---

<br />

# Some problems

error term contains a productivity shock observed only by managers, and may correlates with production decisions.

$$\epsilon_{it}=\omega_{it}+\mu_{it}$$
where $\mu_{it}$ is iid. Meanwhile:

Olley and Pakes (1996) suggest $\omega_{it}$ can be observed via investment.

$$I_{it}=i(k_{it},\omega_{it})$$
inverse, then let $\omega$ follows a first order markov process:

$$\omega_{it}=\phi(I_{it},k_{it})$$
Weaknesses of using investment (Levinsohn and Petrin 2003):
- zero reported investment $\neq$ shock
- less flexible compared to intermediate input

---

background-image: url(normal.png)

<br />

# LP Method

Levinsohn and Petrin (2003) suggest using intermediate input

$$\omega_{it}=\phi(m_{it},k_{it})$$
Therefore, the first-stage becomes:

$$y_{it}=\beta_0 + \beta_ll_{it}+\beta_nn_{it}+\phi(m_{it},k_{it})+\mu_{it}$$
Then proceed as follows to estimate TFP.

$$TFP_{it}=y_{it}-\hat{\beta}_{l}l_{it}-\hat{\beta}_kk_{it}-\hat{\beta}_mm_{it}-\hat{\beta}_nn_{it}$$
The command `levpet` in STATA allows for practical use of the LP method (Petrin, Poi and Levinsohn 2005).

<br />

# Trade policy variable

The dataset allows for multiple goods imported for each firm. The most practical way is to use coverage ratios.

$$T_{it}=\frac{\sum tariff_{sc}V_{sc}}{\sum V_{sc}}*100$$
where:
- $T_{it}=$ tariff coverage ratio of firm i at time t,
- $tariff_{sc}=$ tariff imposed on good s from country c at time t
- $V_{sc}=$ value of good s imported from country c by firm i at time t

And for NTMs:

$$C_{\theta it}=\frac{\sum NTM_{\theta sc}V_{sc}}{\sum V_{sc}}*100$$

where $NTM_{\theta sc}$ is the number of NTM $\theta$ imposed on good $s$ from country $c$

<br />

# Second-Stage

The second stage regression then:

$$tfp_{it}=\gamma_0+\gamma_Tt_{it}+\sum_\theta c_{\theta it}+FO_{it}+\alpha_i+ISIC_i+\eta_{it}$$
Where:
- $tfp_{it} = log(TFP_{it})$
- $t_{it} = log(1+T_{it})$
- $c_{\theta it} = log(1+C_{\theta it})$
- $FO_{it} =$ foreign ownership of firm i at time t (%)

along with firm's fixed effect and ISIC dummy.

# Coverage ratio

.pull-left[
- Table 5 shows simple mean and coverage ratios

- As expected, tariff lies between MFN and FTAs

- Import licensing and quotas is more important than SPS and TBT

- Coverage ratios vs simple mean:
 - no visual difference on tariff
 - firms import more goods with NTMs

# Policy recommendation

- Sometimes, less is more
  - Intervening with trade is usually inefficient
  - at what (who's) cost?
  - ban import doesn't mean domestic will catch up
  - may lead to more intervention

- If scared with CAD, find other ways
  - let IDR weaken?
  - bad debt management $\Rightarrow$ costing manufacturers and consumers
  - become more attractive to business (both domestic and foreign)
  
- Commodities are still the main driver of export, and halting GVC may lead to even more reliance on commodities to keep CA>0

# Caveats

- NTMs have mixed results.
  - Count data isn't ideal
  - May have different impact for different types of NTMs
  - May have different impact on different goods
  - More in-depth studies are needed
  
- The sample is quite restrictive.
  - Importers are different compared to general firms
  - the number of importers is very small
  
- Data isn't perfect.
  - NTM collected in 2015 have slight variation compared to 2018
  - SI have many problems
  - Customs have not go beyond 2012 yet
