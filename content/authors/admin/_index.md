Greetings! My name is Krisna. I am a PhD student at Crawford School of Public Policy, the Australian National University (ANU), Canberra. My research is about trade and investment policy and how it affects Indonesian firms. I use some structured equation such as GTAP model, but also do some empirics like gravity models.

 I use this website as a place to store my CV. I also ocassionally writes (check out posts tab) in english but mostly in Indonesian.
