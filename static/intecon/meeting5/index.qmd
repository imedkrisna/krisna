## Similarities

So far, our models have certain similarities:

1.  Trade is driven by difference in PPF.
2.  PPF determines relative supply scheduule.
3.  World equilibrium ditentukan oleh demand dunia dan posisi kita sebelum trade.

Today, we're standardizing 'em

We continue the case where home country export $C$ and import $F$.

## The standard model

- Relative supply and relative deman

- Terms of trade & welfare

- Effects of economic growth, import tariffs, and export subsidies

- International borrowing and lending

## Principle

1. the relationship between the production possibility frontier and the relative supply curve,

2. the relationship between relative prices and relative demand,

3. the determination of world equilibrium by world relative supply and world relative demand, and 

4. the effect of the terms of trade—the price of a country’s exports divided by the price of its imports—on a nation’s welfare.

## PPF

::: {.column width="47%"}

- What country produces depensd on the relative price of cloth to food $\frac{P_C}{P_F}$

- An economy chose $Q_C,Q_F$ to maximize $V=P_CQ_C+P_FQ_F$ given $\frac{P_C}{P_F}$.

- V is an isovalue of output with slope = $\frac{P_C}{P_F}$

## PPF

![](Picture2.jpg)

When $\frac{P_C}{P_F} \uparrow$, slope gets steeper, production decision moves to Q2. This changes reflected in the market as a relative supply of cloth.

## Relative prices & demand

- The value of the economy's consumption must equal the value of the economyu's production

$$
P_CD_C+P_FD_F=P_CQ_C+P_FQ_F=V
$$

- let's assume the economy's consumption decision may be represented by a single representative consumer.

- more assumption: this decision follows a certain nicely designed function which can be visualized by an indifference curve.

## Price & welfare

![](Picture3.jpg)


When $\frac{P_C}{P_F} \uparrow$, VV's slope steepen. Production & consumption moves from $\{Q^1,D^1\}$ to $\{Q^2,D^2\}$. $D^3=Q^3$ is the autarky equilibrium.

## Case: US & China

- The aggregate gains from trade are in large part driven by consumers’ access to cheaper imported goods.

- On average, US gains from trading with China represented $1,500 per household per year between 2000-2007, mainly from decrease in prices.

- And those price decreases were more pronounced for goods consumed by relatively poorer households.

## Case: Indonesian rice

- Rice import protection is in place to protect farmers' income.

- However, [McCulloch (2008)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00074910802001579) shows that only 25% of HH plant rice, and 80% of them are net consumers in 2004.

    - In 2012, the number is 88% according to [Patunru](https://medium.com/@acopatunru/beras-dan-mitos-762cf88b7bd9#id_token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6IjZmOTc3N2E2ODU5MDc3OThlZjc5NDA2MmMwMGI2NWQ2NmMyNDBiMWIiLCJ0eXAiOiJKV1QifQ.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.C2pudqMajwOvUfR9a807lLxI90lMLjjpEob1WaCjjznC0AlKpxC7u-bmx7QrJASPFd77FejnDLUMmvqUAECdaMym1cwnnIfSfYS8y5ovm6EW9Wc5Z2LIGzVdBr4WLxlCYHuYOWEcow1PyK5T6qnWvvKYD4Hag4Xnho3LTVvdxH1R-QWflfb3oizKDbQqJEQkTTQWlaEqVbcpZEAFxB2kJrvKD0cnEB7Z4hNN-xAsvLzwjmua9cj988XJO-c326opF6Cj4BnGDoRMCWUr07uxJOzBbSs1Y-6M29ru1RQmfsVyxuvl6GRHwt1o56G25CvIRFO-eiL-tohqRn4ZBLM9hA).
    
- Those that gain from higher prices tend to be farmers with access to slightly larger plots of land.

- Thus an increase in the rice price constitutes a transfer from the large majority of consumers to a minority of producers at all income levels.

## Terms of trade {.m}

- The terms of trade refers to the price of exports relative to the price of imports.
When a country exports cloth and the relative

    -price of cloth increases, the terms of trade rise.
    
- Because a higher relative price for exports means that the country can afford to buy more imports, an increase in the terms of trade increases a country’ s welfare.

- A decline in the terms of trade decreases a country’s welfare.

## Determining prices {.m}

- We need to have world quantities from H & F (assume only these 2 countries exist)

$$
\frac{Q_C+Q_C^*}{Q_F+Q_F^*} \\ \frac{D_C+D_C^*}{D_F+D_F^*}
$$

- w/o trade, home has lower $\frac{P_C}{P_F}$ and higher C production relative to F cuz it's good at making $C$.

- trade converges to $RS^{WORLD}$

## Equilibrium prices

![](Picture5.jpg)

Home PPF skews toward $C$ while foreign toward $F$. This differences allow trade to benefit both countries.

## International effects of growth {.m}

- Growth is usually biased: it occurs in one sectore more than others, leads to changes in relative supply & in turn relative prices.

- Rapid growth has occurred in U.S. computer industries but relatively little growth has occurred in U.S. textile industries.

- In the Ricardian model, technological progress in one sector causes biased growth.

- In the Heckscher-Ohlin model, an increase in one factor of production causes biased growth.

## Biased growth

- Biased growth and the resulting change in relative supply causes a change in the terms of trade.

- Biased growth in the cloth industry (in either the home or foreign country) will lower the price of cloth relative to the price of food and lower the terms of trade for cloth exporters.

- Biased growth in the food industry (in either the home or foreign country) will raise the price of cloth relative to the price of food and raise the terms of trade for cloth exporters.

## Biased growth

![](Picture6.jpg)

Growth biased toward cloth shifts the R S curve for the world to the right (a), while growth biased toward food shifts it to the left (b).

## Effects of growth {.m}

- Export-biased growth is growth that expands a country’s production possibilities disproportionately in that country’s export sector.

    - Biased growth in the food industry in the foreign country is export-biased growth for the foreign country.

- Import-biased growth is growth that expands a country’s production possibilities disproportionately in that country’s import sector.

    - Biased growth in cloth production in the foreign country is import-biased growth for the foreign country.

## Terms of trade

- Export-biased growth reduces a country’s terms of trade, reducing its welfare and increasing the welfare of foreign countries.

- Import-biased growth increases a country’s terms of trade, increasing its welfare and decreasing the welfare of foreign countries.
