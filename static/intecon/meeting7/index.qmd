## So far

- we have discusses extra-industry trade, where countries are buying and selling different goods (e.g., cloth exporter and food exporter)

    - can be driven by difference in technology or factor abundance.

- In industries with significant fixed cost,  we also see that intra-industry trade benefits.

    - gains come from economies of scale, number of brands, and improvement of average productivity.
    
## Today

- Today we discuss the concept of offshoring.

- We also unpack the concept of unbundling stages of production.

## Offshoring {.m}

- The provision of a service or the production of various parts of a good in different countries that are then used or assembled into a final good in another location is called **foreign outsourcing**.

    - sometimes called offshoring.
    
- Offshoring is a typoe of international trade that differs from the type we see in Ricardian and H-O models where goods traded are **final goods**.

- Offshoring is trade in _intermediate inputs_, which can sometimes crosses several borders before turned into a final good.

## Offshoring

- offshoring is driven by a significant drop in trade cost.
