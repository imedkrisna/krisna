Even though the global goods trade-to-GDP ratio reached its zenith 15 years ago, the rapid rise of services trade has persisted and now accounts for one-fifth of international commerce. The paper makes a statistical and logical case that the future of trade lies in services trade—especially trade in intermediate services.},

   abstract = {This report analyzes the specific factors that affect the competitiveness of developing countries in global value chains (GVCs), and how these factors differ across four major economic sectors: agriculture, extractive industries, manufacturing and offshore services. Although integration into GVCs allows firms in developing countries to participate in international trade without developing the full range of capabilities required to produce a product or service, it will not automatically translate into positive development gains from trade without the appropriate policies to build productive capacity and ensure inclusive growth and upgrading capabilities. In order to inform these policies, it is necessary to identify the various local factors that affected the capacity of developing countries to meet GVC and RVC requirements, including their productive capacity, infrastructure and services, the business environment, trade and investment policies and industry institutionalization. The report identifies the need for further data and analysis in many areas, in particular the trade-related policy implications of TiVA-GVCs for developing countries, including emerging economies. This would provide a starting point for the discussion of the domestic policies and actions needed to promote and support developing countries' beneficial participation in value chains and inform aid for trade interventions promoting effective integration into markets via GVCs.

The empirical strategy employed involves two procedures. The first stage is based on the estimation of productivity from the Cobb-Douglas production function using a semi-parametric method. The second stage involves regressing the derived productivity with servicification, which is proxied by the share of industrial service cost to total input and the share of service revenues to total output. The results show that servification is positively related to productivity. The study also finds evidence of the importance of firm heterogeneity, i.e., foreign ownership and participation in global value chains (GVCs) in boosting productivity.]},

To accomplish this purpose, using the standard gravity model, we ran regressions on bilateral services trade and goods trade between 10 OECD member countries and other economies (including OECD member and nonmember countries) for the years 1999 and 2000. One main and interesting result is that services trade is better predicted by gravity equations than goods trade. Another interesting result is that there is a complementary relationship between goods exports and services imports.},

   abstract = {In March 2007, Indonesia's parliament approved a landmark new law on investment. Law 25/2007 replaces separate laws on foreign and domestic investment from 1967 and 1968, and provides a single legislative framework for domestic and foreign investment. The law states that all business sectors are open to investment, including foreign investment, unless specified in a presidential regulation containing Indonesia's Investment Negative List (DNI). This paper summarises the results of four sector studies undertaken to review implementation of the investment law. The purpose of the DNI is to provide certainty to investors by documenting restrictions in a single list, thereby eliminating the power of ministries to set their own rules. This paper finds that, in practice, considerable uncertainty remains, arising particularly from the law's implementing regulations. Furthermore, new ministerial decrees and laws appear to bypass the list and may reflect a trend towards greater restriction of foreign investment in Indonesia.},

   abstract = {[Manufacturing firms have been increasingly focusing on services, a trend that is evident in their composition of bought-in input and in-house production. The services intensity of firms may affect their productivity and thereby their competitiveness abroad; services are also instrumental in connecting firms to foreign markets and can help them to differentiate their offerings from those of other firms. However, the relation between services and manufacturing exports has only been partially analysed in the previous literature. This study contributes to the field by discussing the role of services for firms and empirically testing a set of related conjectures. Export intensity is regressed on two services input parameters, applying a fractional model to a rich panel of firms in Sweden in the period 2001-2007. The microeconometric results suggest that, after controlling for covariates and heterogeneity, service inputs affect a firms' export capabilities: raising the proportion of services in in-house production yields higher export intensity on average. Furthermore, buying-in more services is associated with higher export intensity for firms in some industries. Overall, the study provides new firm-level evidence of the role of services as inputs in manufacturing.]},

The empirical strategy employed involves two procedures. The first stage is based on the estimation of productivity from the Cobb-Douglas production function using a semi-parametric method. The second stage involves regressing the derived productivity with servicification, which is proxied by the share of industrial service cost to total input and the share of service revenues to total output. The results show that servification is positively related to productivity. The study also finds evidence of the importance of firm heterogeneity, i.e., foreign ownership and participation in global value chains (GVCs) in boosting productivity.]},

   abstract = {In the OECD countries, the decline of manufacturing and the employment implications have long been matters of concern. Recently, policymakers in several countries have set out to try and achieve reindustrialization. The servicification of firms is related to these concerns and aspirations. However, servicification, and particularly its role in trade policy, has received limited attention. I review micro-level evidence and discuss its implications. I find that imported, domestic and exported services are all important to contemporary firm competitiveness and participation in international value chains. Therefore, historic policymaking divisions between trade in manufactures and trade in services services, between export and import interests, and among modes of supply are becoming less relevant. I conclude by suggesting potential steps forward.},

   abstract = {This paper investigates the trend of servicification in global value chains ( GVC s). The degree of servicification is measured as the share of service value added in manufacturing exports. Service inputs are either from domestic market or from foreign countries, which are measured by the domestic servicification and the foreign servicification, respectively. Using the international input–output tables from 1995 to 2011, we estimate the degree of servicification across 61 countries with a focus on Asian nations which have been rarely studied in previous research. We observed an evident trend of servicification in manufacturing in the Asian countries, especially in the 16 countries associated with Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership ( RCEP ). Asian countries tend to have a lower level of domestic servicification but a higher level of foreign servicification than OECD countries. We also identified five key factors in driving the trend of servicification. Countries with broader participation and lower positions in GVC s tend to have higher levels of foreign servicification in manufacturing. Improvements in information and communication technology ( ICT ) also raise the level of foreign servicification. However, countries with a larger supply of service workers, better regulation quality and less government governance have a higher level of domestic servicification in manufacturing.;},
