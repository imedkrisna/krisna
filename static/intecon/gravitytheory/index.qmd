## Intro

- We learn on the theoretical model of gravity equation: from theory to empirics.

- some development of problems and how to tackle 'em

- Preparation on practicing with gravity model.

- main text is Yotov et al. (2016) chapter I

## Why gravity model

- Gravity model is very intuitive.

- It has a strong theoretical foundation.

- Structure is pretty flexible. Can be applied to labor market, investment, environment, etc.

- Remarkable predictive power (with some caveats).

- fit for your empirical thesis. 

## Setting

Now let $Q_i$ be the supply of a good from country $i$ which is fixed with factory gate $i$.

The value of a domestic production in a country $i$ thus

$$
Y_i=p_iQ_i
$$

$Y_i$ is also the nominal income of the country i.

## Setting

Meanwhile, let $E_i=\phi_iY_i$  be the total expenditure of the country i. $0 < \phi_i < 1$ would represent a fraction of $Y_i$ that is spent to be consumed. Therefore, a $(1-\phi_i)Y_i$ is a net export.

Consequently, $\phi>1$ would suggest a net-import economy (i.e., trade deficit).

We can add a time index $t$ if needed. Maybe later.

## Setting

Suppose consumers in a country j have a representative CES-utility function

$$
\left\{ \sum_i \alpha_i^{\frac{1-\sigma}{\sigma}} c_{ij}^{\frac{\sigma-1}{\sigma}} \right\}^{\frac{\sigma}{\sigma-1}}
$$

Where $\sigma>1$ is the elasticity of substitution among varieties of goods from country i. $\alpha_i>0$ is a CES preference parameter for good from country $i$.

## Setting

Consumer maximize its utility with a budget constraint

$$
\sum_i p_{ij}c_{ij}=E_j
$$

Where $E_j$ is a total expenditure of a country $j$. 

Meanwhile, $p_{ij}=p_it_{ij}$ reflects a price in country i times its trade cost $t_{ij}\geq 1$.

Think of the trade cost as an "iceberg" cost: to deliver 1 unit of its variety to country j, country i must ship $t_{ij} \geq 1$ units, i.e. $1/t_{ij}$ of the initial shipment melts “en route”.

## Demand funtion

Optimization on $c_{ij}$ would result in

$$
X_{ij}=\left( \frac{\alpha_i p_i t_{ij}}{P_j} \right)^{1-\sigma} E_{j}
$$

where $X_{ij}$ is the export from origin $i$ to destination $j$. $P_j$ can be interpreted as a CES consumer price index:

$$
P_j=\left( \sum_j (\alpha_ip_it_{ij})^{1-\sigma} \right)^{\frac{1}{1-\sigma}}
$$

## Interpretation

expenditure in country $j$ on goods from source $i$, $X_{ij}$, is:

1. Proportional to $E_j$. i.e., countries with large expenditure buys more from many countries.

2. inversely related to the (delivered) prices of varieties from origin $i$ to destination $j$. Its not just $p_i$ but also $t_{ij}$.

3. Directly related to price index $P_j$, which is a substitution effect.

4. A high $\sigma$ will magnify the substition effect.

## Market clearance

We then clears the market with:

$$
Y_i=\sum_j \left( \frac{\alpha_i p_it_{ij}}{P_j} \right)^{1-\sigma} E_j
$$
WHich means all trade conducted by a country $i$ (including with itself) must be equal to its total production. (i.e., $Y_i \equiv \sum_j X_{ij} \forall i$)

If we define $Y=\sum_i Y_i$ which is the global market, divide both equations with it, then:

## Structural gravity

$$
(\alpha_i p_i)^{1-\sigma}=\frac{\frac{Y_i}{Y}}{\sum_j \left(\frac{t_{ij}}{P_j} \right)^{1-\sigma} \frac{E_j}{Y}}
$$

We substitute a $\Pi_j^{1-\sigma}\equiv \sum_j (t_{ij}/P_j)^{1-\sigma}E_j/Y$, then we get

$$
(\alpha_i p_i)^{1-\sigma}=\frac{Y_i/Y}{\Pi_i^{1-\sigma}}
$$

We now plug this into our $X_{ij}$ to get:

## Structural gravity

\begin{align*}
X_{ij}&=\frac{Y_iE_j}{Y}\left(\frac{t_{ij}}{\Pi_i P_j}\right)^{1-\sigma} \\
\Pi_{i}^{1-\sigma}&=\sum_j \left(\frac{t_{ij}}{P_j}\right)^{1-\sigma}\frac{E_j}{Y} \\
P_{ij}&=\sum_i \left( \frac{t_{ij}}{\Pi_i} \right)^{1-\sigma} \frac{Y_i}{Y}
\end{align*}

We can decompose $X_{ij}$ into two term: the size term ($Y_iE_j/Y$) and the trade cost term ($(t_{ij}/(\Pi_iP_j))^{1-\sigma}$)

## Size effect

- The size term can be interpreted as a hypothetical trade flow if there is no trade cost (ie frictionless trade).

- That is, customers face same factory-gate price no matter where they are.

- The size effect provides us with the intuition that:

    - large producers will export more to all destinations
    
    - big/rich markets will import more from all sources
    
    - trade flows between simiarly-sized countries will be larger.

## Trade cost {.m}

1. Bilateral trade cost between partners i and j, tij , is typically approximated in the literature by various geographic and trade policy variables, such as bilateral distance, tariffs and the presence of regional trade agreements (RTAs) between partners i and j.

2. The structural term Pj , coined by Anderson and van Wincoop (2003) as inward multilateral resistance represents importer j’s ease of market access.

3. The structural term Πi , defined as outward multilateral resistances by Anderson and van Wincoop (2003), measures exporter i’s ease of market access.

## Gravity equation

We log-linearized $X_ij$ to get the following:

\begin{align*}
\ln X_{ij,t}&=\ln E_{j,t}+\ln Y_{i,t}-\ln Y_t \\
&+(1-\sigma) \ln t_{ij,t}-(1-\sigma)\ln P_{j,t} \\
&-(1-\sigma) \ln \Pi_{i,t}+\varepsilon_{ij,t}
\end{align*}

This equation is so popular. Despite that, most students often conduct a consequential mistakes that can be easily remedied with Stata (or R) command. We learn it today so your thesis is safe.
