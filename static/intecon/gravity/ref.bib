   abstract = {On the eve of its 60th anniversary, the gravity model of trade is a `celebrity', due to its intuitive appeal, solid theoretical foundations, and remarkable empirical success. Yet, many economists still view gravity simply as an intuitive but naive reduced-form estimating equation and apply it without guidance from theory, while others are skeptical about its usefulness for counterfactual projections. The objective of this paper is to celebrate the anniversary of gravity by offering a historical overview of its evolution from an a-theoretical application to an estimating computable general equilibrium (E-CGE) model, which can be nested in more complex frameworks. Along the way, I address some misconceptions about the gravity model, summarize the current best practices for gravity estimations, and highlight some properties that have made gravity so successful},

   abstract = {In this article, we present ppmlhdfe, a new command for estimation of (pseudo-)Poisson regression models with multiple high-dimensional fixed effects (HDFE). Estimation is implemented using a modified version of the iteratively reweighted least-squares algorithm that allows for fast estimation in the presence of HDFE. Because the code is built around the reghdfe package (Correia, 2014, Statistical Software Components S457874, Department of Economics, Boston College), it has similar syntax, supports many of the same functionalities, and benefits from reghdfe‘s fast convergence properties for computing high-dimensional leastsquares problems. Performance is further enhanced by some new techniques we introduce for accelerating HDFE iteratively reweighted least-squares estimation specifically. ppmlhdfe also implements a novel and more robust approach to check for the existence of (pseudo)maximum likelihood estimates.},

abstract={This paper documents the construction of BACI, our international trade database, which covers more than 200 countries and 5,000 products, between 1994 and 2007. New approaches have been developed to reconcile data reported by almost 150 countries to the United Nations Statistics Division, collated via COMTRADE. When both exporting and importing countries report to Comtrade, we have two different figures for the same flow, so it is useful to reconcile these into a single figure. To do this, firstly, as import values are reported CIF (cost, insurance and freight) while exports are reported FOB (free on board), transport and insurance rates have to be estimated and removed from import values. We regress the observed CIF/FOB ratios for a given flow on gravity variables and a product-specific world median unit value. In a second step we evaluate the reliability of countries reporting. We decompose the absolute value of the ratios of mirror flows using a (weighted) variance analysis. These measures of the reliability of reported data are used as weights in the reconciliation of each bilateral trade flow which is reported twice. Taking advantage of this bilateral information on each flow, we end up with a large coverage of countries and more reliable data, especially in terms of unit-values. BACI is freely available online to users of COMTRADE database, in different product classifications.},

abstract={The Gravity database gathers a set of variables useful to researchers or practitioners estimating gravity equations. Each observation corresponds to a combination of an exporting country, an importing country and a year (i.e. “origin-destination-year”), for which we provide trade flows, as well as geographic, cultural, trade facilitation and macroeconomic variables.}
