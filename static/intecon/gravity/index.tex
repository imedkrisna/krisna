\begin{abstract}
This page is dedicated to teach students on running the gravity model in
R. We uses dataset from CEPII, specifically BACI and the gravity
dataset. We run in R and RStudio IDE, and we rely on ppml from the
gravity package when demonstrating PPML. We try to replicate Silva and
Tenreyro (2006), an excellent paper for an introduction to the log
gravity model and PPML.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec-introduction}}

The gravity model is probably the most popular model in international
trade. Many uses them. It is very intuitive, great predictive power, and
most importantly, tweakable (Yotov 2022). But the even most important is
that UI students love them. If you're doing trade for your thesis, then
you probably going to use the gravity model as your backbone.

This guide is my attempt to help you learn gravity model much easier.
The most important part is probably the data and the model itself. What
is the minimum things you need in the gravity model, how to arrange the
database, run them, and interpret them. You must familiarize yourself
with the data and its wrangling (80\% of your coding) as well as the
main gravity specification to date. I encourage students to pay careful
attention to Yotov (2022) as it hosts the recent development in the
gravity model, a must read if you're planning to utilize gravity model.

I use R here because I use R much more than Stata these days. However,
the two language aren't very different. You can do the same thing on
both, but you may need to google a bit. It's okay to use google a lot. I
did as well even right now. Oh yeah I also informed you guys know R
already so I won't go into too much basic stuff.

Next is the preparation you'll need. Make sure you read it carefully and
install \& download everything in advance!

\hypertarget{req}{%
\section{Preparation}\label{req}}

This workshop is conducted with the R statistical software, RStudio IDE,
and gravity (Woelwer et al. 2023) package. Of course you're going to
need tidyverse as well, or specifically dplyr package. You want to
procure data beforehand too, and I will use CEPII data. let's discuss
one by one.

\hypertarget{software}{%
\subsection{Software}\label{software}}

You'd want to use R and RStudio for this. The main reason I use R is
because it's free. Stata is not. I think Stata is faster and a bit
easier (R people will kill me if they see this) but not cheap. If you
have Stata it's fine too. The command you'd want in stata is
\texttt{ppmlhdfe}.

Now onto R. You can procure R and RStudio from Posit's website. Get it
\href{https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/}{here}. I wrote the
guide to install R and RStudio
\href{https://www.krisna.or.id/courses/metopel/installr/}{here}, so you
better check it out. It's written in Indonesian.

After that, you are going to need to install some packages. Follow my
step until I told you to do type this on the console
\texttt{install.packages(c("tidyverse","WDI","readxl","kableExtra"))}.
You are going to do the same but you're going to few different stuff.
Specifically, you need to add ``gravity'' and ``writexl'' on the list.
That is, you need to type

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{install.packages}\NormalTok{(}\FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"tidyverse"}\NormalTok{,}\StringTok{"WDI"}\NormalTok{,}\StringTok{"readxl"}\NormalTok{,}\StringTok{"writexl"}\NormalTok{,}\StringTok{"gravity"}\NormalTok{))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

This step requires internet connection, but you'll need to do this only
once.

\hypertarget{data}{%
\subsection{Data}\label{data}}

I procure data for this workshop from {[}CEPII{]}. From their website,
CEPII is:

\begin{quote}
he CEPII is the leading French center for research and expertise on the
world economy. It contributes to the policy making process trough its
independent in-depth analyses on international trade, migrations,
macroeconomics and finance. The CEPII also produces databases and
provides a platform for debate among academics, experts, practitioners,
decision makers and other private and public stakeholders. Founded in
1978, the CEPII is part of the network coordinated by France Strategy,
within the Prime Minister's services.
\end{quote}

I use their BACI dataset (Gaulier and Zignago 2010) and gravity dataset
(Conte, Cotterlaz, and Mayer 2022). You can get those from this
\href{http://www.cepii.fr/CEPII/en/bdd_modele/bdd_modele.asp}{link}.
BACI is under ``international trade'' banner while gravity is under
``Gravity'' banner. Specifically, I downloaded the 2017-2022 version of
BACI and for the gravity dataset I downloaded the R version. You can of
course download whichever version you like but for the purpose of this
workshop maybe its best to stick with the same dataset as I.

You can also download from
\href{https://1drv.ms/f/s!AjelszXKKcmskMsKLZRRwRJq1a2MnA?e=xsdpxL}{my
drive}.

Note that the data here is \textbf{extremely large} in size so be
mindful. You need hefty internet quota and reasonable speed. Also, you
can try opening it with spreadsheet software but unless you have a
strong computer, i'd advice against it. Use R instead.

In the CEPII website you can use various other dataset that may be
useful for you. At the same time, there are various other source you can
utilise for your actual project that's not necessarily from CEPII.

\hypertarget{working-directory}{%
\subsection{working directory}\label{working-directory}}

If you finished downloading data and installing softwares, you then need
to set up a working directory. A working directory is basically a folder
where you have all the data and your R script (R version of do file).
For now what you want is to have a \textbf{folder filled with your
downloaded data}. Make sure you know the path to this folder. I tend to
use easy path for my projects and move it somewhere else when i
finished. If you use github or the likes, it'll be even nicer because
you can actually wipe out your local repo if you finish.

All in all, you should have a folder with these stuff in it:

\includegraphics{pic1.png}

Notes about the data country\_codes, product\_codes and Readme are all
for reading BACI.

\hypertarget{packages}{%
\subsection{Packages}\label{packages}}

for this page I use these packages but you may not need all of them

\hypertarget{simple-gravity-specification}{%
\section{Simple gravity
specification}\label{simple-gravity-specification}}

\hypertarget{theory}{%
\subsection{Theory}\label{theory}}

The earliest (e.g., naive) gravity model taking directly from Newtonian
gravity theory looks something like this:

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq-1}{}{
X_{ij}=\tilde{G}\frac{Y_iE_j}{T_{ij}^\theta}
}\label{eq-1}\end{equation}

where \(X_{it}\) is the value of trade flow from country \(i\) to
country \(j\), \(\tilde{G}\) is the gravitational constant (aka our
usual constant), \(Y_i\) is the output in country \(i\) \(E_j\) is the
value of expenditure in country \(j\) and \(T_{ij}\) is the total
bilateral trade frictions / trade cost between country \(i\) and country
\(j\).

There are various other types of gravity equations, but let's start with
a relatively simple one. One of my favorite simple gravity specification
is a budget version of Silva and Tenreyro (2006) which is taken from
Anderson and Wincoop (2003) which looks like this:

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq-2}{}{
X_{ij}=\alpha_0 Y_i^{\alpha_1}Y_j^{\alpha_2}D_{ij}^{\alpha_3}e^{\theta_id_i+\theta_jd_j}
}\label{eq-2}\end{equation}

where \(\alpha_0\) is your \(\tilde{G}\), while \(Y\) is the output and
expenditure which is proxied with GDP. \(D_{ij}\) is the distance
between the two countries, which can be generalized as a vector of trade
cost measures. Typically we use physical distance but also other types
of bilateral trade cost. Lastly, the \(d_i\) and \(d_j\) is
country-specific characteristics.

There are various variables used in Silva and Tenreyro (2006). log of
exporter's and importer's GDP and GDP per capita. Various ``distance''
variables is used as well e.g., physical distance and variables like
contiguity, common-language dummy, colonial-tie dummy and free trade
agreement dummy.

Note that our regression consists only of two indices: exporter \(i\)
and importer \(j\). We are going to use the gravity data I mentioned
earlier, slice the dataset to cover only one year chosen arbitrarily
(which is 2019), and run Equation~\ref{eq-2}.

\hypertarget{setting-data}{%
\subsection{Setting data}\label{setting-data}}

first we load all the necessary data:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[numbers=left,,]
\DocumentationTok{\#\# Readubg data}
\NormalTok{gravity }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{readRDS}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"Gravity\_V202211.rds"}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{key}\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}}\FunctionTok{read\_csv}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"country\_codes\_V202401b.csv"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The gravity is the data from CEPII while key is storing some country
codes. You can see the first 10 rows of the data and its variable names
you call their name. Just type \texttt{gravity} or \texttt{key} in the
console then hit enter. However, if you just want to look at the
variable names, you can use \texttt{colnames()}

As you can see, the column names are so plenty. Consult to the CEPII
website or Conte, Cotterlaz, and Mayer (2022) to learn more. We will
only use some of them, so we will filter these data to make it more
concise. Specifically, we will (1) remove some countries, (2) remove
non-2019, and (3) remove variables we are not using.

For variables, we will keep iso3\_o, iso3\_d, distw\_harmonic, contig,
comcol, comlang\_off,gdp\_o,gdp\_d, gdpcap\_o, gdpcap\_d,fta\_wto. Note
that o means origin / exporter and d means destination / importer.

You can see in your environment tab the difference between gravity and
gravity2 as well as between key and key2 on the number of observations
and variables. Note that we also log non-dummy variables for gravity2 to
redo Silva and Tenreyro (2006).

We will focus on the gravity2 as it will be the dataset we will run. You
can quickly show summary statistics by typing \texttt{summary(gravity2)}
on the console tab.

You can compare results with Silva and Tenreyro (2006). Note that they
don't use fixed effects.

By the way, you can save the regression table using
\texttt{modelsummary()}. don't forget to run
\texttt{library(modelsummary)} first. You can use xls extension, but
also doc. I personally like .html more.

We then proceed to a higher-dimension trade data which you may be
interested in. In the field, UI students often interested largely in
Indonesian affairs. That is, we are not interested so much in the
bilateral flow of all countries, but only on Indonesia. However, we
often use more granular dimension than just exporter/importer. Often
times we use indices like time, commodities or industries, or even firms
(shamelessly inserting my paper here Gupta (2023)).

Now, if you are planning to do these kinds of studies, then you are
going to need to tackle higher degree dataset and merging the gravity
variables. Most often you can get these variables from
\href{https://databank.worldbank.org/source/world-development-indicators}{World
Development Indicators} but CEPII is ok for now (note the main problem
of CEPII is its timeliness).

The theory isn't so different compared to our previous gravity model.
What we want is an additional indices. We are going to estimate
something similar as Equation~\ref{eq-2} but with more indices. We need
to care about multilateral resistance (MR) and we can use dummies since
we now have more variations from indices like time and HS code.

According to Yotov (2022), we need at least 3 dummies to run a
multi-country, multi-time and multi-goods/sectors\footnote{unless you
  have domestic trade data which we typically don't. If you do, then
  there's borders dummy. More on Yotov (2022).}. We need to have
exporter-time dummy, importer-time dummy and country-pair dummy. We need
to construct this first. Note that these dummies will likely absorb some
of your variables like distance (consistant between pair across time,
typically).

So we will do the HS,time varying version of Equation~\ref{eq-2}:

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq-3}{}{
X_{ijpt}=\alpha_0 Y_{it}^{\alpha_1}Y_{jt}^{\alpha_2}D_{ijpt}^{\alpha_3}e^{\theta_1o_{it}+\theta_2d_{jt}+\theta_3p_{ij}}
}\label{eq-3}\end{equation}

This time we need BACI data. Brace yourself because this dataset is
HUGE. We read 5 different years.

I used \texttt{read\_csv} from the tydiverse package for reading .csv.
rbind is to stack all BACI data (it was separated per year), then I
remove the individual BACI to save environment space.

At this point, you can try checking out the two datasets. You can try
looking at both data by calling their names. Alternatively, just look at
the column names with \texttt{colnames()}. Let's try the BACI frist.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{colnames}\NormalTok{(trade)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] "t" "i" "j" "k" "v" "q"
\end{verbatim}

There are only 6 columns / variables. Here's some information on what
thos means

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}ll@{}}
\toprule\noalign{}

\midrule\noalign{}
\endhead
\bottomrule\noalign{}
\endlastfoot
t & year \\
i & exporter \\
j & importer \\
k & product \\
v & value \\
q & quantity \\
\end{longtable}

Products in Harmonized System 6-digit nomenclature. Values in thousand
USD and quantities in metric tons. Exporter and importer is codified
using CEPII codes. the codes and it means can be found in the ``key''
dataset. To have country identities into the BACI dataset, we need to
join the two.

To join the two datasets, we need a key variable. A key variable is the
variable connecting the two variables. Both needs the same name. So
first we need to assign the same name for exporter and importer codes
between BACI and gravity.

We know that \(i\) in BACI is iso3num\_o in gravity, while \(j\) in BACI
is iso3num\_d in gravity. So we rename the one in BACI so both have the
same name:

Check the results with gabung or \texttt{View(gabung)}. The most
important thing here is that you have to make sure you understand the
changes in variations! Now that we have time and HS (\(k\)), a pair of
countries can have multiple observations in different year and different
goods. tradeflow\_baci will be repeated because this is the total trade,
while now we focus on \(v\) and \(q\) as the \(X_{ijpt}\).

Before we go, however, we need to generate our dummies! Remember, we
need to make three dummies, \(o_{it}\),\(d_{jt}\) and \(p_{ij}\) (see
Equation~\ref{eq-3}). To do that, we do this:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[numbers=left,,]

         \AttributeTok{ppp=}\FunctionTok{interaction}\NormalTok{(iso3num\_o,iso3num\_d))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

You can check again whether it's made. if you do \texttt{tibble(gabung)}
you will see that we have created our factor variables. Oh yes, do not
forget to log non-factors.

As you can see, the difference is apparent when we use HS-6-digit
instead of total trade. This is of course the case since now we have
wild, uncontrolled variability in the goods characteristics. Indeed, the
gravity equation is much better suited predicting total trade where
country and year characteristics dominates and industry/goods
heterogeneity is absorbed by the total trade. Remember, I use only small
number of countries with tons of HS 6 digit\footnote{I added CHN and USA
  in this version. Previously it was only ASEAN6 and results were pretty
  funny.}. Moreover, PPML sometimes act funny where zeroes are abundant
combined with many dummies. Convergence sometimes unachieved / converge
to a very strange parameters.

UI students typically only interested in Indonesia, so country pair
dummy and indonesia-time dummy often not needed.

OKay now you are ready to run regression yourself. Try to replicate what
I do here and you prolly finished 50\% of your thesis. You then can work
to update this with your own hypothesis, adding more variable and more
concentrated.

Running this on Stata is also excellent. I must confess that R is also
speedy (these guys making the package is extremely good), but Stata is a
bit more intuitive and compute you with important stats as well such as
pseudo-R. Nevertheless, now you should be able to do both!

I cannot emphasize enough references in Yotov (2022). Whatever you want
to do, a paper prolly covered it already. Learn from them and look for
an insight to add. Work with your spv and you'll be fine.
