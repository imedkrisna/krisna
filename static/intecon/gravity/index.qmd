## Introduction {#sec-introduction}

Very important for trade economist.

Using @yotov and @cgz but obviously many other papers you can use.

Most important is familiarize yourself with the data and its wrangling (80% of your coding) as well as the main gravity specification to date. I encourage students to pay careful attention to @yotov as it hosts the recent development in the gravity model, a must read if you're planning to utilize gravity model.
