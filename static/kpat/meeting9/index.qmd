## Today

- A reminder on the Global Value Chain.

- Production network pattern in ASEAN.

- Increasing importance of China in the region.

## Some stats

- East Asian non-oil exports recorded 3-fold increase between 69/70 - 90/07: from 11% of global non-oil exports to 33%.

- Japan dominated the 60s and 70s (60% of total east asian exports). This figure drops significantly to 20% in the late 00s.

- China has been the main story, but also other regions.

- Asian exports are 92% manufacturing goods.

## The flying geese

- Flying geese model coined by Akamatsu (1961, maybe earlier): Production moves from the lead to rearguard countries, starting with labor-intensive industries.

- The Lead geese is Japan

- Second tier are South Korea, Singapore, Tainwan and Hong Kong.

- Third tier is Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia

- Rearguard: China, Vietnam, etc.

## The flying geese

- At the beginning, Japan grew faster in Asia (somewhere in the early 1900s to the 1960s)

- At some point, Japan wage level became too expensive, and it sources labor-intensive industries to the second tier of the flock.

- The second tier grew, then outsource its labor-intensive to the third tier. The second tier then develop its own innovation as well.

- At it keeps on happening untul the rearguard.

- GVC changed this model slightly in the 80s

## Framework

- In East Asia, the second unbundling concept has been central to their development strategy.

- Kimura (2017) identifies 4 concepts:

    - Fragmentation theory (aka. the global value chain)
    
    - Two-dimensional fragmentation
    
    - New economic geography
    
    - Trade in value added (TiVA)

## Global Value Chain

![Typical Global Value Chain (GVC) of an airplane industry](feenstra.png)

## GVC {.m}

- large reduction of trade cost mean firms can engage in trades in intermediate inputs.

- Activities of a production process can be separated and move into countries with comparative advantage in those sectors.

- This changes the calculation of industrial policy: free flow of goods is actually important for firms to marginally exploit its advantage

- Labor-abundant countries like Vietnam can participate in the value chain of high-tech products by doing the assembly while import tech-heavy components from abroad.

- Backward participation like this is [crucial](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10290-022-00476-z) for an industry to learn and upgrade.

## GVC

## GVC

- The prototype of such model in ASEAN was the Penang export processing zone (EPZ) in the 70s to early 80s.

- The EPZ manufactured semiconductors with 100% imported components for 100% foreign market (i.e., 100% import and 100% export)

- Hong Kong and China relationship on garment and light industries, where HK firms operates in China, utilizing the rules of origins and wage difference.

- The important piece (tech owner) is still the head of the geese.

## 2D Fragmentation

- in the firm's perspective, there are 2 important considerations:

    - Geograpihcal distance: the farther, the costlier fragmentation becomes.
    
    - Control: how much tasks actually gets outsourced
    
- Longer-distance transaction tends to be intra-firm, while closer tasks are usually outsourced.

- The close-distance transactions is the backbone of agglomeration in developing countries.

## 2D Fragmentation

## Agglomeration

- If developing countries want to move up the value-chain, local firms must be able to participate in the value chain.

- It often comes through supplying lead firms (typically MNC FDI).

- The lead firm often provides schematics and know-how for the SMEs. Out of numbers of them, some may learn and upgrade.

- China largely succeed in utilizing this strategy (Chor, Manova, Yu 2021)

## Core-periphery

- external economies of scale suggests that concentrating a large industry in one place benefit the world by reducing the cost for all.

    - This is called concentration forces e.g., scale, matching, market access.
    
- However, comparative advantage of certain tasks create an incentives to move some tasks to a periphery economy

    - Dispersion forces e.g., less congestion, low trade cost, wage differences.
    
- nickel is a great example for this model.

## Core-periphery

## TiVA

- Using [international input–output tables](https://www.oecd.org/sti/ind/measuring-trade-in-value-added.htm), allows us to measure the domestic/foreign value-added ratios embodied in each country’s
production and exports.

- This allows us to calculate the upstream–downstream position of each country’s
industries. 

- Although the input–output analysis itself is an old quantitative technique, the TiVA framework enables us to visualise the overall picture of GVCs.

## East Asia network

- East Asia's production network relies mostly on electrical machinery, particularly semi-conductor devices.

- This is true for both components and final products.

- Automotive is quite the opposite: only 4.7% in East Asia but around 33% in the Americas.

- 2 posible reasons: protectionism and low value-to-weight ratio.

## Chinese role

According to the [ASEAN Statistical yearbook 2021](https://asean.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ASYB_2021_All_Final.pdf), China in 2020:

- Largest source of import (23.5% of total ASEAN imports)

- Second largest destination of exports (15.7% of total ASEAN exports)

- 5% of total FDI in the region

- More than 22% of total visitors in 2019, the largest.

## Chinese role

- Trade with China is [massive](https://data.aseanstats.org/dashboard/imts.hs2)

- China-East Asia trade flow accounts for nearly 90% of exports and imports in total manufacturing.

- Increased imports of components from East Asia from 18% to 44% of total component imports from 94/95 to 06/07.

- Chinese exports to East Asia drop from 55.8% to 33.7%.

- "component bias": China's component import is increasing, while exporting final goods more to the world.

## Chinese diplomacy

- Success in economic reform & fast growth in the 1990s instils confidence in the Chinese government in its external relations.

- “China’s foreign policy is transforming from inward-looking, mainly concerned about its own development, to outwardlooking, concerned both about its own development and the development of the world.” (Wang Yizhou in 2004).

- Zhu Rongji proposed CAFTA (China-ASEAN Free Trade Agreement) in 2001, which was enforced in 2010.

## Against the US

- Decoupling thesis: after the Asian Financial Crisis in 97/98, Asia will decouple with the west.

- IMF and western conditional debt irks many political figures in East Asia.

- This "Chinese appeal" was deemed crucial for China to propose the CAFTA.

## Conclusion {.m}

- Manufacturing in ASEAN is closely related to the giants in the region.

- GVC and core-periphery models create a unique network where big firms in the region leads.

- ASEAN was supposed to be the next-layer Geese, but China increasingly become important as a production base for the lead to supply the world.

- Innovative Local firms are important, which ASEAN lack.

- Remains to be seen how US-China would affect.

## Further study

- Earlier studies were focusing on machinery, automotive and electronics.

    - Green goods and services are increasingly important.
    
- IO table has been improved and certainly can be useful for your thesis.

- You can certainly update figures in this lecture, especially amid various global challenges.
