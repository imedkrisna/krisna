## Today

- A reminder on the Global Value Chain.

- Production network pattern in ASEAN.

- Increasing importance of China in the region.

## Global Value Chain

## GVC {.m}

- large reduction of trade cost mean firms can engage in trades in intermediate inputs.

- Activities of a production process can be separated and move into countries with comparative advantage in those sectors.

- This changes the calculation of industrial policy: free flow of goods is actually important for firms to marginally exploit its advantage

- Labor-abundant countries like Vietnam can participate in the value chain of high-tech products by doing the assembly while import tech-heavy components from abroad.

- Backward participation like this is [crucial](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10290-022-00476-z) for an industry to learn and upgrade.

## The flying geese

- Flying geese model coined by Akamatsu (1961, maybe earlier): Production moves from the lead to rearguard countries, starting with labor-intensive industries.

- The Lead geese is Japan

- Second tier are South Korea, Singapore, Tainwan and Hong Kong.

- Thir tier is Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia

- Rearguard: China, Vietnam, etc.

## Chinese role

- Trade with China is [massive](https://data.aseanstats.org/dashboard/imts.hs2)

## Chinese role

According to the [ASEAN Statistical yearbook 2021](https://asean.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ASYB_2021_All_Final.pdf), China in 2020:

- Largest source of import (23.5% of total ASEAN imports)

- Second largest destination of exports (15.7% of total ASEAN exports)

- 5% of total FDI in the region

- More than 22% of total visitors in 2019, the largest.


## Chinese diplomacy

- Success in economic reform & fast growth in the 1990s instils confidence in the Chinese government in its external relations.

- “China’s foreign policy is transforming from inward-looking, mainly concerned about its own development, to outwardlooking, concerned both about its own development and the development of the world.” (Wang Yizhou in 2004).

- Zhu Rongji proposed CAFTA (China-ASEAN Free Trade Agreement) in 2001, which was enforced in 2010.
