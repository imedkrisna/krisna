## Role of services

- With the ever decreasing cost of trade, separating a value up to tasks level.

- Feedback mechanism from the third unbundling may benefits domestic manufacturing.

- In fact, exporting high-value services directly can be a good strategy for growth.

- More [here](https://www.krisna.or.id/intecon/services/services#/title-slide)

## Services in manufacturing

- Melitz: non-trivial trade cost makes small-margin firms lose.

- Services can lower this cost: brigde information gap on the market, business customs and regulations in other countries, especially for new firms entering export market

- In Sweden, firms with higher services embeded in its final products increases its intensity of export

- In Indonesia, 10 per cent increase in service intensity of a firm increase its productivity by 7 to 8 per cent

## Today

- We are going to do similar gravity regression as I show in Advanced International Economics (Ekinterla, see [here](https://imedkrisna.github.io/gravity/))

- We are going to add two variables: share of foreign services and share of domestic services.

- The rest, we follow the same structure as my ekinterla course.

- My talk should be limited in time. Let's focus on exercises.

## Gravity {.m}

- [Click here for today's workshop](https://1drv.ms/f/c/acc929ca35b3a537/EoAYeK0gjzdJg6jR75NJODwBQXvFuwnjpjVohP_FrwIRGA?e=93daD2)

- You will see four files:

    - 2018.csv contains the ICIO file
    
    - gravity.R is the gravity regression file
    
    - gravity2018.xlsx is the BACI data i've manipulated for the course
    
    - service.R is the share of services extraction file
    
## ICIO {.m}

ICIO is an international input-output table maintained by the OECD. Download [here](https://www.oecd.org/en/data/datasets/inter-country-input-output-tables.html)  and see [here](https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/development-of-the-oecd-inter-country-input-output-database-2023_5a5d0665-en.html) for explanatory notes.

- The ICIO table shows you how much an industry in a country's output is used by industries in different countries.

- By the same token also shows where inputs for an industry in a given country come from.

## Discussion

- Try to replicate my results and let's discuss.

- I will standby. Unmute yourself anytime or alternatively use chat. 

- You can share your screen if needed.
