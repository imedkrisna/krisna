## TOday

- We will discuss a chapter by Verico and Natanael.

- The development of digital economy in ASEAN rests on 2 points of the ASEAN way:

    - Soft approach: maximizing consensus with no vote or veto. Challenging amid diverse economies.
    
    - Open: Utilizing the ASEAN+ framework.

## Digital services

- 4 modes of trade in services:

    - Mode 1 - cross-border supply: consumer & producers remain in their countries (like goods).
    
    - Mode 2 - consumption abroad: consumers go to the provider's country.
    
    - Mode 3 - commercial presence: producers establish a presence in the consumer's country.
    
    - Mode 4 - presence of natural persons: producer goes to consumer's country for a while.

## Digital services {.m}

- Perpres 44 2016 removes e-commerce from negative investment list.

- 15 – 20 % of total FDI are in e-commerce, according to BKPM ([tirto.id, 2019](https://tirto.id/tiap-tahun-e-commerce-ri-diguyur-investasi-asing-usd25-miliar-dhQw))

- As the growth of online consumers increases (60-70% annually), FDI to this sector will only grow faster.

- e-commerce-related import of goods grows [9% annually](https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2019/02/13/e-commerce-responsible-for-worsening-trade-deficit.html)

- With more sophisticated shipment, import facilitation (e.g. Lazada), and payment options, foreign firms may be better off selling from home instead of doing FDI.

## Digital services

- digitally delivered trade as international transactions electronically delivered remotely through computer networks, including insurance and financial services, professional services, sales and marketing, research and development, and education services ([UNCTAD 2022](https://unctad.org/publication/digital-trade-opportunities-and-actions-developing-countries))
