## Climate change

- About 60% of crop yield variability can be influenced by climatic conditions.

- Duration of growing season changes.

- Home to largest race importer & exporters.

## Climate change

- climate change leads to rising sea level, prolonged drought, floods, and storms.

- Global externalities: global impacts and global solutions.

- humanitarian crises, fast population displacement through migration, intensified reliance on imports for vital commodities, and even fuel conflicts.

- All countries must collaborate.

## ASEAN

- Home of Four of the top 10 nations globally affected by climate change: Myanmar, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam.

- Home of 50 coastal cities projected to affected heavily by the rise of sea level.

- Indonesia emerged as the country with the highest GHG emissions in the ASEAN region in 2021, recording 2.05 billion tons. 

    VietNam 507.34 million tons, Thailand  452.12 million tons.

## Agri emission {.m}

- Deforestation is one of the leading causes of emissions in the agriculture 

    - notably for large-scale commercial farming and palm oil plantations,

- Between 2007 and 2018, deforestation generated around \$48 billion (5.7% of gross domestic product, GDP)

- however, air pollution and fire damage offset over half of this.

- Urban congestion from personal vehicles costs about 0.5% of GDP, while air pollution shortens the average Indonesian citizenâ€™s life expectancy by 1 to 4 years (Greenstone and Fan 2019). 

## Forest service {.m}

- Forests provide various ecological services beyond their local surroundings, such as air filtration, groundwater replenishment, and temperature regulation.

- Forests offer economic advantages and improve community resilience at the local level, notably during natural catastrophes

- High deforestation rates, however, pose serious dangers, as do predicted habitat and biodiversity losses of up to 40% by 2100.
