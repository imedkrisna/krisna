## Recap on last week

- We've learned various types of costs

- Two different levels of $Q$:
  - cost minimizing when $MC=ATC$
  - profit maximizing when $MC=MR$

- We've learned the condition in perfect market:
  - $P$ is independent of producer's decision
  - hence: $MR=P$

---

## Today

- Entry and exit

- What happens when the market is a monopoly

- Price discrimination

# Entry & Exit

---

## Entry & Exit

- To construct the overall supply curve, we need to look at what Liv would do in different price setting.

- We have different level of Q. Time to learn different types of prices for supplier.

- Two types of Prices:
  - **Break-even price** = minimum ATC
  - **Shut-down price** = minimum AVC

---

## Break-even and Shut-down

- **Break even price** is the price level where Liv is operating at the lowest profit.
  - She might not want to produce at a loss.

- If price goes below break-even price, shutting down may not be necessary.

- In the short-run, fixed cost must still be paid regardless of Q produced. It's better to produce to cover some of the fixed cost.

- **Shut-down price** is the price level where Liv can still cover her variable cost, and have something left to cover a fraction of the fix cost.

### Liv's Cost Structure Again

### Break-even & loss

.pull-left[.s[
```{r tab2,echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
liv1<-data.frame("Q"=liv$q,"MC"=liv$MC,"AVC"=liv$AVC,"ATC"=liv$ATC)
kable(liv1,format = "html", align = "cc",digits=2) %>%
  row_spec(4,background="blue") %>%
  row_spec(2,background="grey")

```
]]

.pull-right[
- Two different prices:
  - shut-down price = 12
  - break-even price = 72

- Below $72, Liv is operating at a loss.

- Above $12, Liv still manage to retain some of the fixed cost.
]
---

## Up the industrial curve

- Different producer may have different cost structure.

- Marginal cost is important because it determine lowest ATC (the break-even price) and profit.
  - MC is essentially the supply curve.
  
- When price below break-even price, firms only exit in the long run.
  - still produce while lowering fixed cost.

- When price below shut-down price, firms exit immediately.

## Perfect competition characteristics

- Entry & exit is important for a perfect market characteristics.

- An industry which have low shut-down price and break-even price tend to be more competitive.
  - When these prices are low, more entrepreneurs can join in.
  
- Low cost of entry and exit ensures a smooth adjustment of market.

---

## Perfect competition

- The cost of entry and exit is very relative and a little bit hard to judge whether it's "low" or "high".

- Second characteristic is **many producers with small market share**

- **Market share** is a measure on how much a firm gain revenue from a market.

- Even when there are many producers, it is not competitive if the market is dominated by small number of sellers.

---

## Perfect competition

- When a market consists of many sellers, market won't react too much when there is only one or two firms enter and exit.

- When a _warteg_ is closed, nobody cares.

- When a Electric Vehicle (EC) investor come in, it will be a headline.

---

## High market share

- When a market is dominated by small number of players, we say the market is **concentrated**.

- Market concentration may be caused by a highly efficient firms:
  - very low cost.
  - superior quality at similar price.

- It can also be caused by some characteristics special to the product.
  - compatibility of complement
  - exclusive content
  
???

compatibility of complement: OS, electric charging for electric cars,
exclusive content: netflix vs prime, console wars, etc

---

## Standardized product

- Market tends to be more competitive when the product from a firm is undistinguished from other firm.
  - buyers don't care from which firm they purchase their goods.
  - firm have less control over price.
  
- In general, firms who wish to capture more market have two strategies:
  - **lower cost**.
  - **product differentiation**.

# Monopoly

---

## Deviation from perfect competition

- So far we have seen the importance of a perfect market:
  - producer is a price taker.

- We have seen that supply curve is essentially the marginal cost, which derives from the cost function.

- Cost C(Q) is a positive function of Q.
  - meaning, more Q leads to higher C(Q)
  
---

## Deviation from perfect market
  
- but price is independent.
  - $\text{profit}=Q*P$ which is a linear function.
  - Marginal Revenue (MR) = price.
  - firms compete by lowering C
  
- **Product differentiation** may provide a firm to control their own price to some extent.

- When a firm can control price, price is no longer independent of firms' decision

- $MR=MC$ still hold, but with control over price, a firm can now **choose their MR**

---

## Deviation from perfect market

- To see how this happens, we use **monopoly** as our first deviation from the perfect market.

- Monopoly is the other extreme of a perfect market.
  - most markets are somewhere in between.
  
- As usual, learning how the extreme works often easier and intuitive.

## Market structure

From extremely strong market power to no market power:

| type | differentated <br> product? | no. of <br> producers | example |

| Monopoly &nbsp; | not aplicable | &nbsp; 1 &nbsp; | electricity |
| Oligopoly &nbsp; | can be both | &nbsp; few &nbsp; | Internet Service|
| Monopolistic competition &nbsp; | &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; yes | &nbsp; many &nbsp; | Smartphone |

# Side note: What's a market?

Sometimes it is hard to define market. A Carrefour vs KPPU case is famous for [debate about market definition](https://www.eastasiaforum.org/2009/09/10/is-there-a-carrefour-monopoly-in-indonesian-retailing/): Did Carrefour compete against only wholesale like supermarket and hypermarket retailing, or also mini-markets and traditional markets?

---

class: middle, center

# Side note: What's a market?

How broad the definition of market should be? Smartphone is another excellent example. **Samsung galaxy Note series** can be argued to operate in a **differentiated smartphone market** thanks to its exclusive feature called S-pen. However, in the **low-end smartphone market**, it has little to no difference with other cheap smartphone, hence closer to a **perfect market**.

---

## Monopoly

- A producer is a **monopolist** if it is the **only** supplier of a good that has no **close substitute**.

- An industry is a **monopoly** when it runs by a monopolist.

- Monopoly operates by changing its production output and captures as much **Producer Surplus** as it could.

- Normally, more producer would want to enter the market. Why they could not?
  
---

## Why do monopolies exist

Generally, there are 5 reasons why monopolies (or oligopolies) exist

1. Control over scarce resource and input.

1. Increasing returns to scale industry.

1. Technological superiority.

1. Network externality.

1. Government-created barrier.

---

## Control over scarce resource and input

De Beers is famous for having control over diamond. Indofood who controls flour production have a huge advantage in the instant noodle market.

---

## Increasing returns to scale

When an industry have a very big fixed cost, a firm in that industry needs huge market share to maximize **spread effect**. Building internet infrastructure is expensive (tower, cable, etc) and a huge commitment.

A monopoly created and sustained by increasing returns to scale is called a **natural monopoly**.

---

## Technological superiority

- Intel managed to dominate the semi-conductor market thanks to its technological superiority over its competitor.
  
- However, technology can be researched and (to some extent) stolen.

- This makes technological superioriy less important compared to other reasons.

- Do not mixed tech superiority with network effect.

---

## Network effect

- An industry has **network effect** when the value of a product and service in that industry depends on how much users it has

- Network effect is very prominent in industries related to tech: Social media, Online games, Ride-sharing etc

- Google's search algorithm might not be superior, but it has much larger data thanks to the amount of users of its service, browser and android phone.

- Some said MacOS is better than Windows. But most developers make windows based apps.

---

## Government-Created Barrier

- The most important legally created monopoly these days maybe come from **patents** and **copyrights**.

- Patents and copyrights are important to provide incentives (at least temporary) for people to create and innovate.

- as soon as the patents and copyrights are over, it moves closer to a perfect market.

- Could lead to a missed opportunity, however.

- We also have Bulog, Pertamina and PLN.

---

## How monopolist maximize profit

- A firm operates in the perfect market face a flat demand curve
  - this is because price is independent
  
- However, monopolist face a market demand curve instead of an individual demand curve.

- Monopolist maximize profit by setting $MR=MC$, but they have control over their $MR$

- Last week: Liv's MR = P because no matter how much she sell, price stays $100

- For monopolist, when they produce more, price goes down, while producing less increases price.

- increasing price decreases quantity bought (**Quantity effect**), while increasing margin per item sold (**price effect**)
  - remember tax revenue?

## Monopolist decision making

- Monopolist finds these the balance btween quantity effect and price effect by setting:

$$ MR = MC $$

- The profit-maximizing price is called **monopoly price**, while the profit-maximizing quantity is called **monopoly quantity**.

- Since there's no firm can join in, cost won't be reduced (very close) to zero at all.

## Dealing with monopoly

- Many countries try to reduce monopoly (and oligopoly) by fine and avoiding a merger.
  - Depends, some natural monopoly is hard to dealt with.

- In Indonesia, the most prominent institution combating monopoly and oligopoly is [KPPU]()(Komisi Pengawas Persaingan Usaha)
  - Telco, airfare, food industries, among other cases.
  
- There are few ways a government generally try to deal with monopoly
  
---

## Dealing with monopoly

1. Public ownership, like Pertamina, PLN, Bulog and PT. KAI.

1. Price ceiling / floor. This can be useful when market is not perfect. For example, A minimum wage can be useful when employers are too powerful.

In general, it is really hard to deal with monopoly because there's a trade off.

- Drug patent leads to monopoly, but important to incentivies innovation.

# Price Discrimination

---

## Why price discriminate

- When a monopolist charge one price, it lost a chance to profit from people who can't afford that price.

- If there is a way to charge different price to different types of customer, monopolist can capture more surplus.

- This practice is called **price discrimination**.

## Price discriminiation

- Obviously, people won't buy the more expensive ones if the product are the same.

- Some common techniques:
  - Advance purchase restrictions: early bird airfare tickets
  - Volume discount: less per unit cost if you buy bulk. eg: [short, tall, grande, venti](https://www.eater.com/2011/1/17/6701687/starbucks-to-launch-a-31-oz-big-gulp-of-coffee-the-trenta).
  - Two part tariff: you pay a flat rate to enter, but pay per-unit cost to upgrade.
  - Student price.
  - Time price: Gojek is expensive when rains, hotelroom rent price during holiday season.
  
---

## Price discrimination

- Interestingly, price discrimination is less bad compared to single price monopoly.

- Price discriminiation reduces DWL, adding a little bit of consumer surplus and producer surplus.

- Still less ideal compared to a lower-single-price monopoly, let alone a perfect market

- Price level from best to worst:

$$P^* > P_{m2} > P_{m1} + P_{m2} > P_{m1}$$

Next week we are going to learn other deviations from the market.

Oligopoly and externalities are the two most prominent market failure.
