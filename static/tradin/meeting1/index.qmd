# Questions?

## Knowing my class

- Let's talk about your:
    - name
    - work / future work
    - what is your expectation from this course

# Introduction to trade & industry

## Why trade

- There's gain from trade from specialization (aka comparative advantage)

- Even if a country knows how to make everything, it's still better for them if they trade.

-   Why? opportunity cost and resource constraints.

- Trade is also the fastest way for developing countries to catch up. Leapfrogging even!

## Why not trade?

-   Trade gain does not shared equally

    -   Economic transition often beneficial for 1 group at the expense of other group.
    -   Trade & industrial policy often created with a specific sectors in mind (may leave other sectors in the dust.)

-   There are other goals more important than economic efficiency.

-   Blaming foreigners is always easier (they don't affect your election)

-   Policy makers don't understand economics.

## Some misconceptions

-   Trade surplus is "good" and "competitive".

    -   BILATERAL trade surplus is "good".
    -   SECTORAL trade surplus is "good".

-   Deficit in current account must be counteracted with trade restriction.

-   Trade is easy to manage.

-   Weak exchange rate is "bad".

## Thinking forward

-   Use (dan empirics) untuk mendebat kebijakan.

    -   Remember, most policy's justifications are market failure.
    -   analogy is powerful.

-   Keep policy objectives in mind.

    -   Does it interfere with other objectives? Any better ways to get them?

-   Policies are politics & administrative processes.
