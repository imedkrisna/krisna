## Basic assumption

- No economics and/or mathematics background.

- Some experience in CIPS' work.

- chance is, I can learn from you. So don't be shy.

## Why Economics

- Economics is NOT about (just) money!

- Economics is a study of optimization: how to get the best under constraints.

    - The same with engineers!
    
    - We use very similar tools!
    
- Increasingly, economics also do empirics!

## Theory vs Empirics

- Theory: If X leads to Y while Z does not lead to Y, then lets do X.

- Does X really lead to Y while Z does not?

- The first is the optimization part, the second is the empirical part.

- But stil, relationship between Xs & Ys is what interests all economists.

## Some questions

- How to best tackle climate change?

- Is minimum wage good?

- Should we ban trade to industrialize?

- How to best feed our people?

- Should we invest in school or road?

## About economics

- Some of my blogpost to get a glympse of what economists do:

    - [Consumption-saving decision](https://www.krisna.or.id/post/surga/)
    
    - [how to set the price on toll road](https://www.krisna.or.id/post/jorr/)
    
    - [FDI, trade and industry policy](https://www.krisna.or.id/post/hitektrade/)


- Naturally, economists often specialize more on issues.

    - I'm more on trade, industry, investment. Knows next to nothing about education & welfare program issues.
    
## Why people make choices

- The main reason is resources' scarcity.

- resource = anything you use to get what you want.

- mainstream resources are money; Given 4k trilyun APBN, what program should we finance?

- But other resources are important too: time, people/institutions, inflation.

## Opportunity cost

- The true cost of something is its possible other uses. Money is the least of our concern.

- The cost of having holiday, for example, is the money & time you could otherwise use to join a short course.

- The cost of doing an S1:
    
    - Go straight to work, get experiences & money
    
    - Do other degree
    
    - enjoy life
    
- I daresay opportunity cost is the core concept of economics!

## Thinking at the margin

- The principle of opportunity cost leads to a marginal thinking

- understand the status quo, then think if it can be (marginally) improved.

- e.g., say you have 2 hours to spent on work or play. how to divide?

    - depends: when's the work deadline?
    
    - if you work for another 30 minutes, would that help with work?
    
## Specialization & trade

- During your daily time, you make decisions on allocating how much time to study and to cook, among other things.

- Since you will die if you don’t eat, you can’t allocate 0 hour to cook.

- On the other hand, there are those who are very good cook and will cook for you for a little money.

- In this case, it may be better if you spend 0 hour to cook, and order food from these chefs.
  
- Trade is the reason why I can study economics: I don’t have to study how to be a doctor. I will just go to the hospital if I need a medical service.

## SPecialization & trade

- Extending to firm level:

    - Why build our own office suit if we can buy microsoft office?
    
    - Why build our own server if there's AWS, Biznet, others?
    
- Easily extending this to country level:

    - Japan's capital & labor are mobilized to make cars cuz they get less if they plant palm oil.
    
## Typical problem

- Most policy makers & policy analysts are stumble in the trade argument because they often forgot about **resource constraints** and **opportunity cost**.

    - leads to a macro-policy which aims at increasing **everything**.
    
- our land, workforce, APBN, etc are limited.

- Even if you have a lot of resources, for example, the extra money could be better spent to grow one thing.

## Equilibrium

- When there is an incentive to do something, there will be more and more people exploit it.

- As more people do it, the incentive decreases to a point where it is not worth it anymore.

- examples:
  
    - City becomes more crowded (and costly to live in).
  
    - Stock price stops growing few moments after its IPO.
  
    - Countries' economic growth reduced after they get rich.

- Movement towards equilibrium, however, varies.

    - short run vs long run.
    
    - individual vs aggregate.

## Conclusion

- Main principles: scarcity, opportunity cost, marginal thinking, & equilibrium.

- Economics gets much more complicated that this.

- The principle, however, remains the same (more or less)
