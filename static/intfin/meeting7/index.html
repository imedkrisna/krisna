<h2>Intro</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>We have learnt concepts like UIP and CIP.</p></li>
<li><p>We combine that with our understanding of GDP, GNE and GNDI in the open macroeconomic setting.</p></li>
<li><p>We will see how these concepts translate to IS-LM model: a framework we use to analyze the economy in the short run.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="assumptions" class="slide level2">
<h2>Assumptions</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>We analyze a (small) Home country <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> and a (large) Foreign ‚Äúcountry‚Äù <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> which consists of the rest of the world (ROW).</p></li>
<li><p>Since it‚Äôs short run, prices are sticky both at home <span class="math inline">\((P=\bar{P})\)</span> and foreign <span class="math inline">\((P^*=\bar{P}^*)\)</span>. Since price is sticky, expected inflation is zero <span class="math inline">\((\pi^e=0)\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>We assume that government spending ùê∫&nbsp;ÃÖ and taxes ùëá&nbsp;ÃÖ are fixed, but subject to policy change.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="assumptions-1" class="slide level2">
<h2>Assumptions</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>We assume that foreign output <span class="math inline">\(\bar{Y}^*\)</span> and the foreign interest rate <span class="math inline">\(i^*\)</span> are fixed. Our main interest is in the equilibrium and fluctuations in the home economy.</p></li>
<li><p>We assume that income <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is equivalent to output; that is, gross domestic product (GDP) equals gross national disposable income (GNDI).</p></li>
<li><p>We assume that net factor income from abroad (NFIA) and net unilateral transfers (NUT) are zero, which implies that the current account (CA) equals the trade balance (TB).</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="consumption" class="slide level2">
<h2>Consumption</h2>
<ul>
<li>The simplest model of aggregate private consumption relates household consumption <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> to disposable income <span class="math inline">\(Y^d\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{Consumption}=C=C(Y-\bar{T})
\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li><p>This equation is known as the Keynesian consumption function.</p></li>
<li><p>Marginal Effects The slope of the consumption function is called the marginal propensity to consume (MPC). We can also define the marginal propensity to save (MPS) as 1 ‚àí MPC.</p></li>
</ul>

<img data-src="Picture1.jpg" class="r-stretch quarto-figure-center"><p class="caption">The Consumption Function The consumption function relates private consumption, C, to disposable income, Y ‚àí ¬Øùëá. The slope of the function is the marginal propensity to consume, MPC.</p></section>
<section id="investment" class="slide level2 m">
<h2>Investment</h2>
<ul>
<li>The firm‚Äôs borrowing cost is the expected real interest rate <span class="math inline">\(r^e\)</span>, which equals the nominal interest rate <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> minus the expected rate of inflation <span class="math inline">\(\pi^e\)</span>:</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math display">\[
r^e = i ‚àí \pi^e
\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Since expected inflation is zero, the expected real interest rate equals the nominal interest rate, <span class="math inline">\(r^e = i\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Investment I is a decreasing function of the real interest rate. So investment <span class="math inline">\(I(r)\)</span> falls as the real interest rate rises.</p></li>
<li><p>But expected inflation is zero, so the real interest rate equals the nominal interest rate. We can then write <span class="math inline">\(I(i)\)</span>.</p></li>

<section id="the-government" class="slide level2 m">
<h2>The Government</h2>
<ul>
<li>Assume that the government collects an amount <span class="math inline">\(\bar{T}\)</span> of taxes from households and spends an amount <span class="math inline">\(\bar{G}\)</span> on government consumption.</li>
<li>We will ignore government transfer programs, such as social security, medical care, or unemployment benefit systems.</li>
<li>In the unlikely event that <span class="math inline">\(\bar{G}=\bar{T}\)</span> exactly, we say that the government has a balanced budget.</li>
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(\bar{T}&gt;\bar{G}\)</span>, the government is said to be running a budget surplus (of size <span class="math inline">\(\bar{T}-\bar{G}\)</span>).</li>
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(\bar{T}&lt;\bar{G}\)</span>, there is a budget deficit (of size <span class="math inline">\(\bar{G}-\bar{T}\)</span> or, equivalently, a negative surplus of <span class="math inline">\(\bar{T}-\bar{G}\)</span>).</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="the-trade-balance" class="slide level2 m">
<h2>The Trade Balance</h2>
<ul>
<li>When aggregate spending patterns change due to changes in the real exchange rate, this is expenditure switching from foreign purchases to domestic purchases.</li>
<li>If home‚Äôs exchange rate is E, and home and foreign price levels are <span class="math inline">\(\bar{P}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\bar{P}^*\)</span> (both fixed in the short run), the real exchange rate q of Home is defined as <span class="math inline">\(q=E \times \bar{P}^*/\bar{P}\)</span>.</li>
<li>We expect the trade balance of the home country to be an increasing function of the home country‚Äôs real exchange rate. As the home country‚Äôs real exchange rate rises, it will export more and import less, and the trade balance rises.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="the-trade-balance-1" class="slide level2 m">
<h2>The trade balance</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>We expect an increase in home income to be associated with an increase in home imports and a fall in the home country‚Äôs trade balance.</p></li>
<li><p>We expect an increase in rest of the world income to be associated with an increase in home exports and a rise in the home country‚Äôs trade balance.</p></li>
<li><p>The trade balance is, therefore, a function of three variables: the real exchange rate, home disposable income, and rest of world disposable income.</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="mpc" class="slide level2">
<h2>MPC</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>We refer to MPCF as the marginal propensity to consume foreign imports.</p></li>
<li><p>Let <span class="math inline">\(MPC_H &gt; 0\)</span> be the marginal propensity to consume home goods. By assumption, <span class="math inline">\(MPC = MPC_H + MPC_F\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>For example, if we have <span class="math inline">\(MPC_F = 0.10\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(MPC_H = 0.65\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(MPC = 0.75\)</span>; for every extra $1 of disposable income, home consumers spend 75 cents‚Äî10 cents on imported foreign goods and 65 cents on home goods (and they save 25 cents).</p></li>

<h2>US case</h2>

<img data-src="Picture4.jpg" class="r-stretch quarto-figure-center"><p class="caption">The Real Exchange Rate and the Trade Balance: United States, 1975‚Äì2012. The data show that the U.S. trade balance is correlated with the U.S. real effective exchange rate index. Because the trade balance also depends on changes in the United States and rest of the world, disposable income (and other factors), it may respond with a lag to changes in the real exchange rate, so the correlation is not perfect (as seen in the years 2002‚Äì2007).</p></section>
<section id="dollar-passthrough" class="slide level2 m">
<h2>Dollar passthrough</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>A composite or weighted-average measure of the price of goods in all foreign countries relative to the price of U.S. goods is constructed using multilateral measures of real exchange rate movement.</p></li>
<li><p>Applying a trade weight to each bilateral real exchange rate‚Äôs percentage change, we obtain the percentage change in home‚Äôs multilateral real exchange rate or real effective exchange rate:</p></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\frac{\Delta q_{\text{effective}}}{q_{\text{effective}}}=\left(\frac{Trade_1}{\sum Trade}\frac{\Delta q_1}{q_1}\right)+\left(\frac{Trade_2}{\sum Trade}\frac{\Delta q_2}{q_2}\right)+\cdots

<section id="usd-passthrough" class="slide level2 m">
<h2>USD passthrough</h2>
<ul>
<li>If you are someone who earns and pays consumption with more than 1 currency, exchange rate may have different effect on your consumption compared to someone who only earns and pays with 1 currency.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{Home real XR}=d \frac{\bar{P}^*}{P_1}+(1-d)\frac{\bar{P}^*}{P_2}
\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li>when d=0, all home good are priced in local currency and we have our basic model. In this case, 1% rise in E leads to 1% rise in q, thus a <strong>full passthrough</strong> of E to q.</li>

<p>Two important observations are in order:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In an open economy, lower interest rates stimulate demand through the traditional closed-economy investment channel and through the trade balance.</p></li>

</ul>
<p>We have now derived the shape of the IS curve, which describes goods and forex market equilibrium:</p>

<h2>IS-LM-FX, Short Run</h2>
<p>We focus on the two main policy actions: changes in monetary policy, via changes in the money supply, and changes in fiscal policy, via changes in government spending or taxes.</p>
<p>The key assumptions of this section are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The economy starts in long-run equilibrium. We then consider policy changes in the home economy, assuming that conditions in the foreign economy are unchanged.</p></li>
<li><p>The home economy is subject to the usual short-run assumption of a sticky price level at home and abroad.</p></li>
<li><p>Furthermore, we assume that the forex market operates freely and is unrestricted by capital controls and that the exchange rate is determined by market forces.</p></li>

<h2>Stabilization policy</h2>
<p><strong>Policy Constraints</strong> A fixed exchange rate rules out use of monetary policy. Other firm monetary or fiscal policy rules, such as interest rate or balanced-budget rules, limit policy.</p>
<p><strong>Incomplete Information and the Inside Lag</strong> It takes weeks or months for policy makers to understand the state of the economy today. Then, it takes time to formulate a policy response (the lag between shock and policy actions is called the inside lag).</p>
<p><strong>Policy Response and the Outside Lag</strong> It takes time for whatever policies are enacted to have any effect on the economy (the lag between policy actions and effects is called the outside lag).</p>
</section>
<section id="stabilization-policy-2" class="slide level2 m">
<h2>Stabilization policy</h2>
<p><strong>Long-Horizon Plans</strong> If the private sector understands that a policy change is temporary, there may be reasons not to change expenditures. A temporary real appreciation may also have little effect on whether a firm can profit in the long run from sales in the foreign market.</p>
<p><strong>Weak Links from the Nominal Exchange Rate to the Real Exchange Rate</strong> Changes in the nominal exchange rate may not translate into changes in the real exchange rate for some goods and services.</p>
<p><strong>Pegged Currency Blocs</strong> Exchange rate arrangements in some countries may be characterized by a mix of floating and fixed exchange rate systems with different trading partners.</p>

<h2>Stabilization policy</h2>
<p><strong>Weak Links from the Real Exchange Rate to the Trade Balance</strong></p>
<p>Changes in the real exchange rate may not lead to changes in the trade balance. The reasons for this weak linkage include transaction costs in trade, and J curve effects.</p>
<p>These effects may cause expenditure switching to be a nonlinear phenomenon: It will be weak at first and then much stronger as the real exchange rate change grows larger.</p>
<p>For example: Prices of BMWs in the United States barely change in response to changes in the dollar‚Äìeuro exchange rate.</p>
