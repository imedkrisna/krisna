## Intro {.m}

- In this chapter, we study economic transactions between countries, how they are undertaken, and what impact they have on the macroeconomy.

- The first task of any macroeconomist is to measure economic transactions.

- The goals of this chapter are to:

    - Explain the international system of trade and payments

    - Discover how international trade in goods and services is complemented and balanced by a parallel trade in assets

    - Understand how these international transactions relate to national income and wealth

## Measuring macro

- At various points in the circular flow of payments, a nation’s aggregate economic activity is measured and recorded in the national income and product accounts.

- In an open economy, however, such measurements are more complicated because we must account for cross-border flows. 

- All of these additional flows are recorded in a nation’s balance of payments accounts.

## Measuring macro {.m}

- *Gross national expenditure (GNE)* is the total expenditure on final goods and services by home entities in any given period. It is made up of three parts: personal consumption C, investment I, and government spending G. GNE = C + I + G

- A country’s *gross domestic product (GDP)* is the value of all (intermediate and final) goods and services produced as output by firms, minus the value of all goods and services purchased as intermediate inputs by firms.

- In a closed economy, income is paid to domestic entities. It thus equals the total income resources of the economy, also known as *gross national income (GNI)*.

The Closed Economy Measurements of national expenditure, product, and income are recorded in the national income and product accounts, with the major categories shown. The purple line shows the circular flow of all transactions in a closed economy.

## Open economy

- The difference between payments made for imports and payments received for exports is called the trade balance (TB), which equals net payments to domestic firms due to trade. 

- GNE plus TB equals GDP, the total value of production in the home economy.

- The value of factor service exports minus factor service imports is known as net factor income from abroad (NFIA), and thus GDP plus NFIA equal GNI, the total income earned by domestic entities from all sources, domestic and foreign.

## Open economy

- Gifts may take the form of income transfers or “in kind” transfers of goods and services. 

- They are considered nonmarket transactions, and are referred to as unilateral transfers.

- Net unilateral transfers (NUT) equals the value of unilateral transfers the country receives from the rest of the world minus those it gives to the rest of the world.

## Open economy

- These net transfers have to be added to GNI in order to calculate gross national disposable income (GNDI). 

- Thus, GNI plus NUT equals GNDI, which represents the total income resources available to the home country.

The current account (CA) is a tally of all international transactions in goods, services, and income (occurring through market transactions or transfers).



:::

## Asset side {.m}

- The value of asset exports minus asset imports is called the *financial account (FA)*. 

- These net asset exports are added to home GNDI when calculating the total resources available for expenditure in the home country.

- A country may not only buy and sell assets but also transfer assets as gifts. 

- Such asset transfers are measured by the *capital account (KA)*, which is the value of capital transfers from the rest of the world minus those to the rest of the world.

The Open Economy Measurements of national expenditure, product, and income are recorded in the national income and product accounts, with the major categories shown on the left.
Measurements of international transactions are recorded in the balance of payments accounts, with the major categories shown on the right.
The purple line shows the flow of transactions within the home economy.
The green lines show all cross-border transactions.

## Three approach {.m}

- The expenditure approach looks at the demand for goods: It examines how much is spent on demand for final goods and services. The key measure is GNE.

- The product approach looks at the supply of goods: It measures the value of all goods and services produced as output minus the value of goods used as inputs in production. The key measure is GDP.

- The income approach focuses on payments to owners of factors: It tracks the amount of income they receive. The key measures are gross national income (GNI) and gross national disposable income (GNDI) (which includes net transfers).

## Expenditures

Personal consumption expenditures (usually called “consumption”) equal total spending by private households on final goods and services. This includes nondurable goods (e.g., food), durable goods (e.g., autos), and services.

Gross private domestic investment (usually called “investment”) equals total spending by firms or households on final goods and services to make additions to the stock of capital. This includes construction of a new house or factory, the purchase of new equipment, and net increases in inventories of goods held by firms (i.e., unsold output).

## Expenditures

Government consumption expenditures and gross investment (often called “government consumption”) equal spending by the public sector on final goods and services. This includes spending on public works, national defense, the police, and the civil service. It does not include any transfer payments or income redistributions, e.g., Social Security or unemployment insurance payments—these are not purchases of goods or services, just rearrangements of private spending power.

## GNE GDP

$$
GDP=\underbrace{C+I+G}_{\text{GNE}}+\underbrace{\left(X-M\right)}_{\text{Trade Balance}}
$$

The trade balance (TB), also referred to as net exports, may be positive (trade surplus) or negative (trade deficit).

## GNI

Gross national income equals gross domestic product (GDP) plus net factor income from abroad (NFIA).

$$
GNI=\underbrace{\underbrace{C+I+G}_{\text{GNE}}+\underbrace{\left(X-M\right)}_{\text{Trade Balance}}}_{\text{GDP}}+\underbrace{\left(EX_{FS}-IM_{FS}\right)}_{\text{NFIA}}
$$

## GNI GNDI

A country which engage in in kind transfer has Net Unilateral Transfer (NUT), so that:

$$
\underbrace{Y}_{GNDI}=\underbrace{\underbrace{C+I+G}_{GNE}+\underbrace{(X-M)}_{TB}+\underbrace{(EX_{FS}-IM_{FS})}_{NFIA}}_{GNI}+\underbrace{(UT_{IN}-UT_{OUT}}_{NUT})
$$

For some country, NUT can be very large. e.g., in West Bank and Gaza, NUT is around 31% of GNI.

## National account {.m}

$$
\underbrace{Y}_{GNDI}=\underbrace{C+I+G}_{GNE}+\underbrace{\underbrace{(X-M)}_{TB}+\underbrace{(EX_{FS}-IM_{FS})}_{NFIA}+\underbrace{(UT_{IN}-UT_{OUT}}_{NUT}}_{\text{Current Account (CA)}})
$$

- On the left is our full income measure, GNDI. 

- The first term on the right is GNE, which measures payments by home entities. 

- The remaining terms measure net payments to the home country from all international transactions in goods, services, and income. We group the three cross-border terms into an umbrella term that is called the current account (CA).

## Current account {.m}

$$
Y=C+I+G+CA
$$

- This equation is the open-economy national income identity. It tells us that the current account represents the difference between national income Y (or GNDI) and gross national expenditure GNE (or C + I + G). Hence:

- GNDI is greater than GNE if and only if CA is positive, or in surplus.

- GNDI is less than GNE if and only if CA is negative, or in deficit.

## Current account {.m}

The current account is also the difference between national saving (S = Y − C − G, by definition) and investment:

$$
\underbrace{S}_{Y-C-G}=I+CA
$$

This equation, often written as CA = S – I , is called the current account identity even though it is just a rearrangement of the national income identity.


- S > I if and only if CA is positive, or in surplus.

- S < I if and only if CA is negative, or in deficit.

Meanwhile in Japan, saving rate keeps decreasing since 1970. However, Japan constantly see saving>investment (surplus CAB) with notable exceptions.

USA constantly has higher GCF compared to its saving rate. Meaning, US sees a constant CAD (current account deficit) which seems to be increasing in 2000s.

This graph shows current account balance of the 4 countries. Indonesia sees a surplus during the commodity boom, but overall moves around. China and Japan sees a constant surplus while the US a constant deficit. Japan and China = net creditors, USA = net debtor.
